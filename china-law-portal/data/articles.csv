A Case Study of Chinese Netizens?? Opinions on Capital Punishment,"Jianhong Liu, Bin Liang","Jian Hong Liu, & Bin Liang, A Case Study of Chinese Netizens?? Opinions on Capital Punishment: Diversity, Rationale, and Interaction, 45(6), Modern China, 666, 666?C692 (2019).",Modern China,https://journals.sagepub.com/home/mcx,https://doi.org/10.1177/0097700418819833,"Empirical studies of Chinese public opinion on capital punishment are very rare. Almost all past studies suffered from questionable survey designs and/or nonrepresentative/nonrandom sampling (e.g., student samples). In this study, to examine the breadth and the depth of public opinion on capital punishment, we turn to Chinese netizens?? opinions online on a particular capital case, the Lin Senhao poisoning case. Though our netizen sample has its own limitations, it is innovative and encompasses a broader group of representations than in past studies. Specifically, we address three questions: the diversity of netizens?? opinions, the rationales for netizens?? support for Lin??s death sentence, and netizens?? interactions. This study is the first to examine Chinese netizens?? opinions in a capital case in detail and to uncover potential complexities and nuances of such opinions.","This study is the very first to examine netizens opinions in depth in a famous capital case. Our analysis has focused on three issues: the diversity of netizens opinions, the rationales for netizens support for Lins death sentence, and the interactions among netizens. Despite the innovative nature and strength of our data, there are some limitations to our methodology. First, our sample could have suffered from selection biases. For instance, people who do not have access to the internet due to the digital divide may have held different opinions on capital punishment. Second, our data lacked individual and personal background information. One particular concern is the identity of the netizens whose online comments we analyzed. In addition, it is unknown to what extent governmental censorship might have played a role (e.g., through hiring official trolls to clean the net). Third, our analysis in this study was limited to only one murder case, and netizens opinions may be very different in other capital cases (e.g., corruption cases). Despite these limitations, a number of potential lessons can be drawn from netizens discussions.
First, though most netizens (by our count) supported Lins death sentence, there is considerable variation in the breadth and the depth of netizens comments. Strikingly, there was both support and opposition to almost every subject discussed by netizens, from support for and justification of Lins death sentence, to sympathy for Lin, to views about Lins and Huangs families, to views about Lins defense, and to issues about judicial verdicts. For instance, netizens explicitly called for the abolition of Chinas death penalty in ninety-three comments, questioned the utility of capital punishment and the fairness of its use, and even argued that it is barbaric and a violation of human rights. Such bold voices and opposition show that the claim of overwhelming public support for the death penalty is likely misleading and fails to uncover the nuances of netizens opinions.
Second, despite the diversity in opinions, the influence of Chinese culture on the opinions of the majority of netizens is apparent. Concepts such as sharen changming and killing one to deter a hundred heavily influenced netizens?? support for Lin??s death sentence. It is also interesting to see how a traditional sense of justice and fairness turned around against the victim??s family when Huang??s father was pondering a suit for ",,"""In this study, to examine the breadth and the depth of public opinion on capital punishment, we turn to Chinese netizens?? opinions online on a particular capital case, the Lin Senhao poisoning case... we address three questions: the diversity of netizens?? opinions, the rationales for netizens?? support for Lin??s death sentence, and netizens?? interactions.

Second, though not a national representative sample, Chinese netizens serve as a better representation than samples in previous studies. The China Internet Network Information Center (2017) reported that the total number of Chinese internet users (defined as ??Chinese citizens who used the internet in the past six months?? in the survey) had reached 751 million (54.3% of China??s total population) by June 2017, and 96.3% of them (i.e., 724 million) access the internet via their mobile phones.

In the debate over whether autocracy excels democracy in containing the COVID-19 outbreak, some argue that the aggressive, extensive and effective implementation of the Draconian containment measures indicates the powerful ability of Chinas political system to rally, organize, mobilize, appeal, and act (despite the inevitable cover-up resulting from the very same political system) which, once again, shows evidence of a highly resilient and powerful state.Footnote90 Only some putting forward the China model acknowledge the high economic cost and concern of sustainability entailed in this model.Footnote91 Nevertheless, this article shows that this assessment uses a utilitarian approach to assess another utilitarian approach by downplaying, if not completely overlooking, the violations of human rights and dignity as the real cost.

As the two largest fashion markets in the world, these countries both have controversies over the optimal IP protection against knockoffs. This study reveals that similar disputes have occurred in both countries because IP laws are not primarily designed for fast-changing fashion products. Although courts in both countries have handled identical legal issues, such as separability in copyright law, distinctiveness in trademark law, and patentability for designs, their approaches are quite different. While the U.S. doctrines, such as functionality in three-dimensional trademarks and trade dress protection for product packaging, are more developed in precedents, the Chinese doctrines, such as copyrightability in garment designs, are sometimes led by industrial policies. Since the Chinese government has been determined to develop its fashion industry, these two major economies will continue to compete to be not only the largest fashion economy around the globe but also the best legal environment to foster fashion creativity. The broader implication of this Article is that IP issues in the fashion industry have demonstrated how two distinct legal frameworks, characterized by comparable regulations yet varying social and economic standings, address analogous legal challenges.""","""Despite the fashion industrys growing importance to the global economy, leadingfashion companies have been struggling to protect their designs against cheap knockoffs via existing IP regimes in both the United States and China, the two largest markets for the consumption of fashion products. These efforts have been largely in vain because none of the existing IP laws are specifically designed for this fast-changing industry. In both the United States and China, the designs in numerous fashion products fail the separability test in copyright law, distinctiveness requirement inDesign brands have encountered different challenges in these two major economies.First, the separability test in U.S. copyright law follows an established analytical framework that distinguishes useful articles from fine arts. Although China incorporates a similar concept of separability, its judiciaries have not yet developed consistent views on whether the applied arts should be treated differently from other copyrightable works. Second, the United States and China have rather different approaches to the distinctiveness requirement for non-traditional trademarks. Three- dimensional trademarks that consist of the shape or design of a product per se are presumed to be inherently indistinctive in the United States, whereas they could be inherently distinctive under certain exceptional circumstances in China. With regard to color trademarks, China adopts a more conservative approach than the United States does, as the former denies the registrability of single colors on absolute grounds, whereas the latter does not have a per se prohibition against the registration of a single color.

APOLOGY AS AN INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY REMEDY IN CHINA: A PRELIMINARY EXAMINATION OF AMERICAN LITIGATION EXPERIENCES,Robert H. Hu,"Robert H.

In recent years, litigation and apologies appear to be natural elements of contemporary life in China. Apologies as a legal remedy in Chinese laws and regula- tions have become prevalent for nearly four decades. In particular, in intellectual property law, the last thirty years have witnessed an explosion of apology cases. In such litigation, plaintiffs seek (and sometimes ob- tain) apologies from the defendants as a statutory remedy besides injunc- tion and damages. American businesses operating in China increasingly take to the Chinese courts to protect their intellectual property, and seek- ing apologies during litigation is deployed as a useful strategy to curb intellectual property thefts.
""This article explains the legal remedy of apologies popular in China but not commonly understood outside of the country. The essay discusses the evolution of Chinese apology laws and examines in depth apologies as a legal remedy in intellectual property laws and litigation. Based on more than a dozen judicial opinions, this essay considers the experiences of American corporations seeking apologies in Chinese courts and ana- lyzes the facts and issues of such litigation. Some preliminary assess- ments and recommendations are made following this examination with the hope of providing useful guidance.""","""What happens in China has critical implications for the U.S. and the world. The apology laws and litigation profoundly affect businesses, per- sonal interactions, and other aspects of life in China. This raises immi- nent and continuous challenges to American businessmen and right-hold- ers doing business in China. The examination of American IP cases in China demonstrates that American right-holders are adapting to Chinese laws and customs, using apologies as a supplemental measure to protect IPRs in the country. There are at least two lessons that can be learned from past experiences. First, apologies offer an additional tool against intellectual property rights violators in China, and this remedy may be useful due to its effects in shaming and possible deterrence. Right-hold- ers should work with their local counsel to evaluate the strengths of their case carefully before initiating litigation and should request apologies only when there is a reasonable likelihood of the Courts approval. The Chinese law of apologies is broad and sketchy, leaving the courts with much discretion. Chinese courts seem more willing to approve apologies in certain copyright, trademark, and unfair competition disputes than in other types of litigation, for example, patent cases. The key to securing a successful apology determination depends on proof of reputational harm to the right-holder; the defendants intent is also relevant. Second, making apologies properly and timely, especially when ordered to do so by the court, can repair or improve a business image and public relations in society. China is an immensely competitive market, and businesses and consumers highly value personal dignity and pride. It is very com- mon for Chinese to go to court and seek apologies against wrongdoers, domestic and foreign alike, when people believe that their dignity or pride is injured. Increasingly, Chinese citizens file litigation and seek apolo- gies from American and other foreign businesses for intellectual property infringement. When the courts approve an apology measure against a foreign party, such a party should comply with the apology order in a timely and proper manner; otherwise, it will risk further reputational da""",,"""The essay discusses the evolution of Chinese apology laws and examines in depth apologies as a legal remedy in intellectual property laws and litigation.""","""The examination of American IP cases in China demonstrates that American right-holders are adapting to Chinese laws and customs, using apologies as a supplemental measure to protect IPRs in the country.""",,Non-Law Theoretical Research,,N: Discusses a contemporary issue,Y: Compares apology culture between Chinese customers and US companies (run by Americans),Y: Approaches the apology culture from social and legal perspectives,"apology phenomenon, personality rights",,,"3.

There are now criminal law procedures that routinely use AI risk assessment tools-from bail hearings to criminal sentencing.8 Over the last few years, businesses have used AI for important test cases and scaled up operations.9 We have also experienced many changes since November 2022 with OpenAI's introduction of ChatGPT and the rollout of Generative AI and Large Language Models in our society. There is naturally much worry over *121 potential job losses,10 misinformation concerning public health and safety,11 interference in the political process,12 and the destruction of creative industries.13
It is no surprise then that enforceable rules concerning responsible use of AI continue to be of paramount importance. There are also the attendant worries over fairness and implicit bias.14 Bias may indeed be baked into the algorithms.15 AI has been found to be racist and discriminatory.16 We rightly ask whether machines can properly apply ethics.17 Other questions ponder the role of machines in developing intellectual property and issues of ownership and filing property interests.18 How can we prevent AI from *122 perpetuating wage inequality?19 Finally, what happens to the more than 300 million people who lose their jobs to AI in the coming years that Goldman Sachs estimates?20
The government of the United States (U.S.) has been slow to craft its own set of priorities, funding opportunities, and national security interests, let alone pass an actual piece of legislation that regulates the AI space. The U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) explored the potential and pitfalls of the regulation of AI in a report released in June 2021:
AI is a transformative technology with applications in medicine, agriculture, manufacturing, transportation, defense, and many other areas. It also holds substantial promise for improving government operations. Federal guidance has focused on ensuring AI is responsible, equitable, traceable, reliable, and governable. Third-party assessments and audits are important to achieving these goals. However, AI systems pose unique challenges to such oversight because their inputs and operations are not always visible.21
There is no shortage of concerns about AI coming from different stakeholders. In March 2023, 1,000 tech leaders, researchers and others, including technology pioneers Elon Musk, Andrew Yang, and Steve Wozniak, released a signed letter that called for a moratorium on the development of the most powerful AI systems.22 Those 1,000 signatures were augmented by another 26,000 signatures within a few weeks.23 By April *123 2023, Geoffrey Hinton, the so-called Godfather of AI,24 resigned from Google, stating that [i]t is hard to see how you can prevent the bad actors using it for bad things.25 The growth in machine learning (ML) technologies is so fast paced that many industries, including music26 and film27 are continually being disrupted.
On May 16, 2023, Sam Altman, CEO of Open AI, the company which developed and deployed ChatGPT to the public, appeared before the U.S. Senate Judiciary Subcommittee, asking for legislation to regulate the use of Artificial Intelligence.28 In his testimony before Congress, Altman stated: As this technology advances, we understand that people are anxious about how it could change the way we live. We are too.29 By November 2023, Altman was fired, hired by OpenAI investor Microsoft, and then rehired by Open AI--all within five days.30 Much of this drama was reportedly related to concerns over AI in the future and the role the company should play in reducing harms.31
To date, the foundational normative work, that may lead to regulatory *124 responses, has fallen to voluntary guidelines given the paucity of formal, legislated, national, and supranational solutions. In the U.S., limited federal direction has been meted out in piecemeal fashion over the years,32 rather than as comprehensive, national legislation (with penalties for those who do not comply). With the U.S. government's laissez faire approach, patchwork of AI-related guidelines, and lack of legislative response, several states and municipalities33 have stepped into the breach. Governmental authorities in the People's Republic of China (China or PRC), on the other hand, have provided some cohesive guidelines for their respective scientists, investors, universities, and corporations to develop and deploy AI tools.
Law and regulations are indeed required,34 not just unenforceable guidelines, frameworks, best practices, or self-regulating standards.35 There have been many calls around the world for governmental authorities to do something about AI creeping into our lives faster than we can navigate, let alone legislate against its dangers.36 For some countries, a sector-specific approach is being piloted.37 The premise is that AI in healthcare can be regulated differently than criminal justice matters. For other countries, a more comprehensive national policy38--not related to any specific sector--has been *125 the approach of choice.
This Article explores the manner in which China and the U.S. are providing differing ethical guidelines and visions for the development and deployment of AI tools.39 This is occurring as the economies of China and the U.S. decouple.40 According to the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace:
A partial decoupling of U.S. and Chinese technology ecosystems is well underway. Beijing plays an active role in this process, as do other governments and private actors around the world. But the U.S. government has been a primary driver in recent years with its increased use of technology restrictions: export controls, divestment orders, licensing denials, visa bans, sanctions, tariffs, and the like. There is bipartisan support for at least some bolstering of U.S. tech controls, particularly for so-called strategic technologies, where Chinese advancement or influence could most threaten America's national security and economic interests.41
The U.S. enacted extensive export controls in October 2022 to keep semiconductor chips and chipmaking equipment out of China. China, in turn, has made it more difficult for U.S. firms to keep doing business in China.42 Bain & Company reported that some companies are closing research and development (R&D) labs and other operations there, and setting up partnerships to sell and distribute products developed and made outside of the country.43 Fears of forced technology transfer and the lack of control over intellectual property (IP) rights44 as well as a general uptick in Chinese bureaucracy for foreign investment make these changes necessary for U.S. *126 corporations.45 It is not just inside the U.S., but the campaign to restrict China's access to high tech components extends to U.S. trading partners.46
Following this Introduction, Part II of this Article provides a very basic explanation of Artificial Intelligence. Part III of this Article explores the ways in which China has set up its own ethical guidelines and varied rules for the future development and use of Artificial Intelligence. The authorities in China have taken some leading steps in reigning in the use of AI for adults and even more so for children.47 Part IV of this Article surveys the ways the U.S. government has regulated AI research and application. The U.S. has developed its own framework and blueprint for action, none of which has yet to be promulgated in legislation.48 These initiatives combine the ideas from industry, government agencies, research institutes, thinktanks, human rights watchdogs, and not-for-profit organizations.49 It is still a blueprint at the end of the day, aspirational rather than operational.
This Article concludes in Part V by exploring the importance of national AI guidelines on the ethical use of AI, ML, and like technology. Because this Article is written in the context of the great decoupling between China and the U.S., the European Union (EU) approach is left for another time. Likewise, this Article does not examine in depth the many other countries which have engaged in developing their own national strategies, ethical guidelines, and laws.50 All these varying national developments beg the question whether an international agency should be founded to transnationally regulate AI research and implementation, an issue which is *127 also explored in Part V, the Conclusion, of this Article.
The broad spectrum of differing approaches to regulation of the AI industry provides a great opportunity to apply the comparativist's lens.51 Professor John C. Reitz has written:
Comparison starts by identifying the similarities and differences between legal systems or parts of legal systems under comparison. However, in performing the basic comparative job of identifying similarities and differences, one has to consider the scope of comparison: What is going to be compared with what? Here the comparatist comes face to face with the enigma of translation.52
Comparative law requires us to acknowledge the differences among legal systems.53 This inquiry goes beyond the classic ??beauty contest?? asking which system is better, a practice sometimes confined to the common law or civil law tradition.54 But, here the competing ??standard?? comes from the PRC,55 a jurisdiction that is based on scientific socialism and controlled by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).56
While this ""","""There is a fundamental problem with the guidelines from China and those from the U.S.: they are not law. Guidelines may serve as a convenient reference tool for governments looking to adopt AI technology and make some media headlines. They can help provide minimum standards for effective, responsible public procurement and use of AI--standards that can eventually be adopted by industry and, more importantly, be enshrined into law. Mark Chinen has written:
There are good reasons why we would like to steer the development of AI applications, but it has been difficult to govern technology, particularly through harder forms of governance such as laws and regulations, even on the domestic level, let alone on the international plane.291
The U.S. and China are not the only two countries working on AI itself while also working on the regulation of Artificial Intelligence. There has been some highly successful collaboration on regulation coming out of the EU, which first commissioned a High-Level Expert Group on AI which released Guidelines for Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence in April 2019.292 The *157 European Parliament completed the first comprehensive legislation293 in the world concerning the development and use of AI, reaching a deal after three days of negotiations in Brussels on December 8, 2023.294 The legislation must still be voted upon by the European Parliament and the European Council, comprising representatives from the EU's twenty-seven Member States.295 It is drafted in the context of other digital policy priorities like cybersecurity, data privacy (the GDPR), and intellectual property protection, all which predate the EU's AI legislative project.
Four years prior, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) announced its own set of five AI principles,296 utilizing a risk-based approach that could become a global benchmark. In 2020 the OECD's Global Partnership on AI and its AI Policy Observatory and Network of Experts on AI supported work among governments to support the development of AI for everyone.297 There is no shortage of examples of best practices among the developed, northern industrialized countries and some developing countries too. For example, Ireland has developed its own national strategy.298 Brazil's Congress has successfully passed a bill that creates a legal framework for AI use.299 So have the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia300 and Germany.301 Israel has also published a set *158 of ethical guidelines on Artificial Intelligence.302
There have been calls to incorporate the various principles and guidelines around the world into a comprehensive framework, understanding how to best integrate them.303 There is a practical reason for this: We operate in a global economy, and many AI projects have co-authors from the U.S. and China. There are Chinese data scientists working at U.S. academic institutions and corporate research laboratories.304 There may indeed be areas for common action from both the U.S. and China as:
[I]nternational cooperation will increasingly take the form of issue-specific coalitions instead of truly international (or even regional) institutions. At times, Beijing and Washington might belong to some of the same clubs: for example, when it comes to nonproliferation of cyberweapons and certain kinds of artificial intelligence tools. In the long run, the digital superpowers could even have a shared interest in introducing and enforcing some international regulations to protect their own companies from being overtaxed by other countries.305
Collaboration among policymakers regarding AI regulation is also crucial.306 An index or framework could be developed to adequately translate the various competing guidelines. The Public Voice's Universal Guidelines for Artificial Intelligence is one such effort.307 So is the International Research Center for AI Ethics and Governance.308 The international community must determine how ethics guidelines can be interoperable. Lax AI--or a paucity of AI--standards should not be a competitive advantage for *159 countries seeking to attract the best talent. This should not be a race to the bottom.309
AI requires updates to our regulatory approach and upgrades to our risk architectures. It may be that the world requires an international agency to regulate AI development and deployment across boundaries. Gary Marcus at a TED conference in Vancouver, Canada, called for the establishment that there be an international institution to help govern A.I.'s development and use.310 Soon thereafter, in mid-May 2023, the Group of Seven (G7) economic group leaders agreed upon a Hiroshima AI Process for the rest of the year to determine a mechanism by which AI is to be regulated.311
It was no surprise that in the summer of 2023, Ant?nio Guterres, the Secretary General of the United Nations (UN), offered to the international community a new UN agency dedicated to Artificial Intelligence.312 After all, [t]he United Nations views itself as playing an important role in the development and spread of emerging technologies.313 In November 2023, UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak brought together political leaders from 28 countries, under the sponsorship of the UN, for an AI Safety Summit.314 The summit, which featured a speech by U.S. Vice-President Kamala Harris, was intended to develop understanding about shared risks and opportunities of *160 AI315 as articulated in the landmark?? Bletchley Declaration.316 For U.K. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak,
[W]e agreed and published the first ever international statement about the nature of all those risks [concerning AI]. It was signed by every single nation represented at this summit covering all continents across the globe ... and including the US and China. Some said, we shouldn't even invite China ... others that we could never get an agreement with them. Both were wrong. A serious strategy for AI safety has to begin with engaging all the world's leading AI powers.317
But there is one caveat: ??Because AI is a multi-faceted capability, ??one-size-fits all?? regulation will over-regulate in some instances and und""",,"""This Article explores the manner in which China and the U.S. are providing differing ethical guidelines and visions for the development and deployment of AI tools.""","""When it comes to the black box that is China??s legal system,323 it is clear we need much more information to understand how the principles and measures announced to date will work together with current laws in force.

This disease caused governments worldwide to declare a public health crisis with severe measures taken to reduce the speed of the spread of the disease. This pandemic affected the lives of millions of people. Many citizens that lost their loved ones and jobs experienced a wide range of emotions, such as disbelief, shock, concerns about health, fear about food supplies, anxiety, and panic. All of the aforementioned phenomena led to the spread of racism and hate against Asians in western countries, especially in the United States. An analysis of official preliminary police data by the Center for the Study of Hate & Extremism at California State University shows that Anti-Asian hate crime in 16 of America's largest cities increased by 149% in 2020. In this study, we first chose a baseline of Americans' hate crimes against Asians on Twitter. Then we present an approach to balance the biased dataset and consequently improve the performance of tweet classification. We also have downloaded 10 million tweets through the Twitter API V-2. In this study, we have used a small portion of that, and we will use the entire dataset in the future study. In this article, three thousand tweets from our collected corpus are annotated by four annotators, including three Asian and one Asian-American. Using this data, we built predictive models of hate speech using various machine learning and deep learning methods. Our machine learning methods include Random Forest, K-nearest neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Naive Bayes. Our Deep Learning models include Basic Long-Term Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Bidirectional LSTM, Bidirectional LSTM with Drop out, Convolution, and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT). We also adjusted our dataset by filtering tweets that were ambiguous to the annotators based on low Fleiss Kappa agreement between annotators. Our final result showed that Logistic Regression achieved the best statistical machine learning performance with an F1 score of 0.72, while BERT achieved the best performance of the deep learning models, with an F1-Score of 0.85.","""We presented a study on recognizing hate speech toward Asians on the Twitter platform during COVID-19. Our contributions in this study are 1) We created a dataset consisting of 10 million tweets related to both COVID-19 and Asians. 2) We chose a baseline that is recent research similar to our topic. 3) We annotated 3,000 tweets by four Asian annotators, and 1,901 of them are the same as our previously annotated baseline. 4) We applied many machine learning and deep learning algorithms to the baseline to find the most accurate one. 5) We improved the performance of the classifiers by measuring the Fleiss Kappa agreement and balancing the dataset accordingly. 6) By filtering only 11.46% of the tweets with a low agreement between raters, we achieved an F1-Score of 0.85 using BERT. Therefore, we conclude that the classifiers performance in hate speech detection on Twitter is related to the agreement between annotators in labeling the data. In addition to the above experiment, we analyzed the features of tweets with high vs. low agreement to understand what kind of language is easily labeled and what kind is more ambiguous. To perform this task, we focus on the following tweets: Tweets labeled unanimously by all five annotators mean the agreement number is 1.
" Tweets with the lowest agreement. We used the threshold <= 0.3 to find these tweets.
We did this analysis on our dataset from phase 2 by making two following sub-datasets:
" Tweets with the complete agreement between annotators, tweets with the agreement 1. There are 758 tweets with agreement 1 in our annotated dataset
" Ambiguous tweets that are tweets with agreement <= 0.3, and there are 135 of them in our dataset
Figures 2D,E, show the distribution of ambiguous tweets and tweets with the full agreement between annotators in three classes.

with public property, previously the only type of asset ownership recognized in

citizens private property rights as inviolable as the states public property rights.
We conducted the study using a panel of prefectures from 1998 to 2012. We ac-

curity in the prefecture. We argue that the prelaw prevalence of privately owned
firms is conditionally independent of potential outcomes.
We find that the Property Law led to an increase in the number of new pri-
vately owned firms, their size (measured by number of employees), and their
number of survivors. This study uses the Property Law as a quasi ? experiment to
demonstrate the counterfactual to de Sotos dead capital and shows that the law
mitigated this problem and brought dead capital to life. Furthermore, the protec-
tions afforded by the law had significant real effects: new firms rapidly increased
their output, sales revenue, and assets, and the number of privately owned firms
that became exporters in the years immediately after they were founded sharply
increased. Behrer et al. (2021) hypothesize that when courts are subverted, prop-
erty rights are ineffective; this accurately describes the prelaw business environ-
ment in China. We affirm this hypothesis for small firms without the resources to
bargain with corrupt courts. By guaranteeing the security of their property rights,
the law led small entrepreneurs who otherwise would not have invested to do so.
The opposite was true for SOEs, which indicates that the law initiated the process
of reallocation. More direct evidence of this is observed in macro outcomesthe
law caused faster growth in prefectures with greater prelaw property rights inse-
curity.
The results test and support the Besley and Ghatak (2009) models that apply
the property rights theory of the firm developed by Grossman and Hart (1986)
and Hart and Moore (1990) to the development context. For example, we find
that the new property rights protections created more firms in contract-? intensive
industries (Nunn 2007). Some of our findings are even stronger than the Besley-Ghatak
predictions. A striking finding is that in prefectures that experienced

Bureaucrats who assist local in- fluentials are neither elite allies nor institutional activists. Instead, they unleash or support collective action as a weapon in a power struggle against ambitious, heavy-handed or corrupt superiors. Unlike mass demonstrations that are mobilized as a bargaining chip, bureaucrat- assisted contention hinges on a partnership with local elites who have their own grievances and pursue their own goals. Because it combines bureaucratic politics and popular action, this type of contention can help us understand underexplored aspects of political opportunities, framing, and mobilizing structures. In particular, it shows how participants in contention sometimes span the state-society divide, and how collective action can influence (and be influenced by) power struggles within a government.""","As the episodes discussed in this article have made clear, bureaucrat-assisted contention is difficult to pull off but often works. A coalition of convenience between native-born officials and local elites can generate enough pressure, when coupled with social mobilization, to get the better of a party secretary in a district, county, or even a province. Ironically, in a regime obsessed with harmony (hexie) and stability, the disruptiveness that makes bureaucrat- assisted contention relatively uncommon can also make it effective, by showing officials at higher levels that something is seriously awry. This echoes the popular Chinese saying that big disturbances lead to big solutions, small disturbances lead to small solutions, and no disturbance leads to no solution, (Cai 2010: 112)1 and suggests that although mobilizing the disaffected and making a commotion is risky in an authoritarian setting, drawing together a range of aggrieved parties, crossing the state-society border, and creating a spectacle (OBrien and Deng 2015: 470) can produce results. Bureaucrat-assisted contention is of course not always successful, and more research is needed to understand when and where it fails. Still, repeated recourse to this type of collective action can have lasting consequences by reconfiguring the relationship between secretaries, local officials, and socioeconomic elites. Once they force concessions or drive a secretary away, native-born bureaucrats are inclined to revive their cooperation with local influentials and launch contention again against a secretarys successor. Aware of what happened last time, new appointees are often more cautious and work harder to avoid simultaneously alienating local officials and elites. Over time, bureaucrat-assisted contention may not even need to be unleashed to have an effect. After more than a decade when maintaining stability has been the regimes top priority (Zhou and Yan 2014), a credible threat is often sufficient to check a secretarys power, ambitions or avarice.
At the same time, it should be noted that although bureaucrat-assisted contention is invariably carried out in the name of a locality, success does not always benefit local residents or even the people who were mobilized to take part. In Shifang county, Sichuan province, for example, a group of mine owners joined forces with native-born officials to stage a noisy antipollution protest that halted the construction of a large, new smelting operation. But the bureaucrats and business people had colluded simply to drive out a competitor who the mine owners feared would be a more efficient and cleaner competitor, and who the officials worried would be more difficult to shake down. The contention and its reputation for instability turned the county into an orphan (guer) that was out of favor with higher levels of government and investors. The collective action had succeeded in blocking the new plant, but the county lost out on a 13.7 billion yuan (US$2.2 billion) investment that would have boosted local incomes, while the mine operators continued to pollute as much as they had before (Yan Dingfei 2014; interview 9).
For students of social movements, bureaucrat-assisted contention draws attention to some less-appreciated aspects of three concepts that have been at the heart of the field for decades. First, it says something unexpected about divisions within the state and defections that provide openings for social forces. Opportunities can arise when a leader pushes subordinates into the arms of local elites who have their own complaints about the leader. Institutional tensions and alienating decisions can generate a rough-and-ready partnership that unites middle-level bureau- crats and influential members of society who have the wherewithal to mobilize the public. Second, like everything associated with bureaucratic-assisted contention, frame alignment cuts across the state-society divide. Local elites use leaked information to turn broad grievances (e.g. dissatisfaction with the environment) into actionable demands.

CHINA DATA FLOWS AND POWER IN THE ERA OF CHINESE BIG TECH,"W. Gregory Voss , Emmanuel Pernot-Leplay","W. Gregory Voss & Emmanuel Pernot-Leplay, China Data Flows and Power in the Era of Chinese Big Tech, 44, Northwestern Journal of International Law and Business,5, 5-66, (2024)",Northwestern Journal of International Law and Business,https://jilb.law.northwestern.edu/issues/china-data-flows-and-power-in-the-era-of-chinese-big-tech/,,"""Personal data have great economic interest today and their possession and
control are the object of geopolitics, leading to their regulation by means that
vary dependent on the strategic objectives of the jurisdiction considered. This
study fills a gap in the literature in this area by analyzing holistically the
regulation of personal data flows both into and from China, the world??s second
largest economy. In doing so, it focuses on laws and regulations of three major
power blocs: the United States, the European Union, and China, seen within the
framework of geopolitics, and considering the rise of Chinese big tech.
First, this study analyzes ways that the United States??the champion of the free-
flow of data that has helped feed the success of the Silicon Valley system??has in
specific cases prevented data flows to China on grounds of individual data
protection and national security. The danger of this approach and alternate
protection through potential U.S. federal data privacy legislation are evoked.
Second, the cross-border data flow restriction of the European Union??s General
Data Prote""","""Data may be a source of government power in terms of national security
and competitiveness. As a result, today personal data protection is the object
of geopolitics, and the three main power blocs covered by this studythe
United States, the European Union, and Chinaall have different strategic
objectives, which influence their choice of the nature of regulation of
personal data. The United States, which historically built its self-regulatory
system in a way that encouraged the development of U.S. big tech that is
centered in Silicon Valley, has chosen a neoliberal policy. The European
Union, which considers data protection as a fundamental right, places the
focus on protecting an individuals rights with respect to the processing of
his or her personal data. In addition, the extraterritorial effect of EU data
protection legislation may be seen to level the regulatory playing field with
U.S. and Chinese big tech. Finally, Chinas view on data protection is closely
linked to national security, social control and power, with government access
to data as an important characteristic.
These different data protection cultures are reflected in the way that
each bloc has chosen to regulate data flowsat the heart of this study which
concerns flows both into and out of China. Although not largely covered
previously in the literature, and certainly not in the same holistic fashion, data
transfer regulation into and out of China has become of great interest today
because of a dawning era of Chinese big tech. Recent and existing regulation
may be seen on a spectrum with the United States described as light touch,
the European Union as prescriptive with conditional transfer, and China as
being categorized into the restrictive or guarded approach, with transfer
restrictions under PIPL and other regulation and data localization under the
CSL. In each case, strategic goals are furthered by the choice of regulation.
However, this picture is neither black nor white, as this study has shown. While the United States promotes free flow of data around the world, when
U.S. individual privacy has been affected by certain Chinese or Chinese-
controlled firms, the United States has taken regulatory or executive action
to prohibit transfers and effectively encourage what might be called soft data
localization. This has occurred in a period of obvious tension between China
and the United States. Yet, the adoption of U.S. federal data privacy
legislation, under consideration in the U.S. legislature today, may be one way
to provide the legal tools necessary to control certain data flows, without
resort to case-by-case executive orders, although this is a matter for future
study. While the few cases cited in this article do not indicate a systemic
change yet, and U.S. limitation of transfers is nothing like the data transfer
restrictions of either of the other two blocs, continuing tensions may change
this. One question this study leaves open, then, is will the United States lean
more to a EU-style prescriptive approach with conditional transfers, or will
it balance more toward a Chinese-style national security model, or neither of
the two?
The European Unions position is based on established law, which in
todays GDPR, is merely an evolution of the 1995 Directive adopted twenty-
nine years ago. It sets out relatively clear criteria for obtaining an adequacy
determination, allowing the free flow of data between the European Union
and the adequate importing nation. However, today China does not benefit
from such a determination and does not enjoy the same geopolitical position
with respect to Europe as the United States does, which allowed that nation
to benefit from the Safe Harbor and the Privacy Shield data agreements in
the past and now from the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework data agreement.
Thus, adequate safeguards must be used to allow for personal data flows from
the European Union to China, and these may be conditioned on the use of
supplemental measures, as well.
A preliminary analysis by this study of the prospects of an eventual
Commission adequacy determination leads to a negative answer, even if
Chinas PIPL features characteristics from the GDPR. Furthermore, some
aspects of China??s data protection laws and regulation cause concern for the
use of adequate safeguards such as EU SCCs to transfer data to China without
supplemental measures and, even then, if the importer could comply with
those clauses in the face of the Chinese government??s right to access data,
presumably without the necessary procedural protections that a Schrems II
transfer assessment would require. In the meantime, EU regulators may be
more watchful of Chinese firms in this new age of Chinese big tech.
With respect to outgoing flows from China, this study has shown that,
while data transfer regulations have not been finally fleshed out with
interpretative guidance, they should be seen to be subject to considerations

novel data set of national civil service exams. Exploiting assignment and tim-
ing variations in anticorruption inspections of government departments, our
difference-? in-differences estimate shows that a department had significantly
fewer applicants following an inspection. We provide evidence that the decline
in bureaucratic entry has occurred since the campaign lowered the (expected)
returns from bureaucratic jobs by improving the detection of corruption and
constraining power that is likely to be abused. In contrast, we do not find evi-
dence that the campaign affected legal income. Furthermore, simulation exer-
cises suggest that after the anticorruption campaign, incoming bureaucrats may
have lower ability but higher prosociality than before.""","""This paper studies how Chinas anticorruption campaign since 2013 has af-
fected bureaucratic entry. Leveraging novel data sources, we document that the
anticorruption campaign has caused a significant decrease in the number of ap-
plicants to bureaucratic jobs. Consistent with predictions of a stylized model of
job choice, there is evidence that the decrease in bureaucratic entry can be due to
improved corruption detection and constraints of bureaucratic power, both of
which lower the expected returns of bureaucratic jobs. Moreover, people entering
the bureaucracy after the campaign may possess lower ability but higher prosoci-
ality on average.
Our findings provoke several additional thoughts that could be interesting av-
enues for future research. First, how can the anticorruption campaign influence
the state capacity of China? The reduced labor supply to the bureaucracy may be
consequential as there are fewer people to carry out policies. Meanwhile, lower
ability but higher prosociality of incoming bureaucrats may have mixed impli-
cations for governance. More empirical evidence is needed to nail down the im-
pacts on state capacity. Second, how does the anticorruption campaign influence economic development? Related to the first thought, changes in state capacity
should influence the economy. Perhaps more important, the campaign may alter
the allocation of talent in China as it may drive talent away from less productive
(and rent-seeking) bureaucracy (Murphy, Shleifer, and Vishny 1991). Third, the
findings indicate that some people may have joined the bureaucracy because of
corruption opportunities. Therefore, reforms of bureaucratic recruitment may be
necessary to screen out corrupt applicants.

nuanced and extensive array of tools to shape global politics. From
trade dependencies to infrastructure investments and direct retaliatory
measures, Chinas economic influence is a crucial aspect of its foreign
policy, impacting nations decision-making processes and fostering
dependencies that encourage or coerce states to align with its
geopolitical objectives. Perceived reliance on trade with China
influences foreign policy choices, leading to potential reversals of
decisions criticized by the PRC and passive shaping of behavior.
Corrupt practices associated with infrastructure investment and
financing provide leverage over foreign leaders and business figures,
reinforcing ties to China. Elite capture creates proxies supporting the
PRCs objectives, aligning with Chinas interests over broader public
concerns. The PRCs comprehensive government control facilitates
official and unofficial boycotts, pressure to induce behavior change in

China's Lehman Brothers Moment: Will the Mainland China's Courts Recognise Hong Kong High Court's Winding-Up Order Against Evergrande?,Shuaihao Mi,"Shuaihao Mi, China's Lehman Brothers Moment: Will the Mainland China's Courts Recognise Hong Kong High Court's Winding-Up Order Against Evergrande?, 33, Norton Journal of Bankruptcy Law and Practice, (2024)",Norton Journal of Bankruptcy Law and Practice,https://www.iiiglobal.org ? file ? 12IiiglobalInternational Insolvency Institute,,"""Over the past decade, China has been slowly yet steadily opening up its market for recognising and assisting foreign insolvency
proceedings. The Supreme People's Court of China (SPC), in the 2014 Thumb case 1 , first recognised the status of foreign insolvency representatives in China. However, this recognition was limited to the capacity of foreign representatives to manage affairs of Chinese subsidiaries on behalf of the foreign parent companies but did not extend to allowing them to remit insolvency assets into their home proceedings. In 2017, SPC introduced a more adaptable presumption reciprocity to replace the previously
rigid de facto reciprocity. 2
On 14 May 2021, SPC and the Hong Kong government signed the Record of Meeting on Mutual Recognition of and Assistance to Insolvency Proceedings Between Mainland China and Hong Kong courts (Meeting Record). To this end, SPC also issued the Opinions on Taking Forward a Pilot Measure concerning the Recognition of and Assistance to Insolvency Proceedings in Hong Kong (Pilot Opinion), using UNCITRL Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency as a reference. The Pilot Opinion has been tested in two cases to be effective. 3 Scholars optimistically believe that these judicial moves are progressively paving the way for adopting the 1997 Model Law in Mainland China. 4
However, there have been concerns that the trend towards the adoption of the Model Law in China may be at a crucial turning
point. In a recent Insolvency case, Re China Evergrande Group 5 , the High Court of Hong Kong ordered to winding-up of Evergrande and appointed liquidators. Judge Linda Chan, who ruled on this case, said she has had enough is enough of Evergrande's repeated failures to present a proper debt restructuring plan, so liquidation may be the better option for protecting
the interests of creditors. 6 Nevertheless, this move may be a drawn-out process for foreign creditors, as over 90% of its assets available for liquidation are in Mainland China. 7
This winding-up order in Hong Kong places China's cross-border insolvency law in the spotlight. An unavoidable question is whether or to what extent this winding-up order in Hong Kong will be respected and enforced by Mainland China's courts. Although a new recognition and assistance mechanism for insolvency proceedings has been established between Mainland China and Hong Kong, it is unclear how the Chinese courts will treat this liquidation order. After all, the catastrophic ripple effects of the ongoing Evergrande crisis on China's financial, property markets, as well as on political and social stability.
This winding-up order issued by the Hong Kong High Court places the Chinese government between a rock and a hard place. There are two options available to the Chinese government to respond to Evergrande's liquidation order, although each option has its unique challenges. First, the Chinese courts can assist the Hong Kong liquidators in collecting, administering and distributing Evergrande's assets located in China in accordance with the Pilot Opinion. By doing so, it allows foreign investors to be confident that their investments located in China will be treated fairly and safely, facilitating the maintenance of their enthusiasm and confidence in the Chinese market. Yet, how the Pilot Opinion will protect 1.6mn Evergrande's pre-sold-but-
unfinished homebuyers are crucial assessments of whether the Mainland courts will recognise this winding-up order. 8 More precisely, in insolvency proceedings, those owners of unfinished housing would become non-adjusting creditors who need
priority protection from Chinese courts; otherwise, they would be a potential source of social discontent. 9
Another way is that Beijing sticks to its previous domestic protectionism in cross-border insolvency, that is, dismissing Hong Kong's liquidation order and forbidding Evergrande's complete insolvency in Mainland China. Evergrande is a main representative of the Chinese real estate market. The real estate sector contributes a quarter of China's GDP, and over 70% of the
personal wealth composition of Chinese households is closely tied to real estate ownership. 10 Evergrande's sudden meltdown could induce a disorderly collapse of house prices in China, resulting in a massive loss of resident's wealth. However, rejecting the liquidation order could mean that the claims of foreign creditors would be little satisfied as Evergrande has fewer overseas assets. Such disparate treatment may discourage foreign investors from investing in the Chinese market, which in turn will make it more difficult for Chinese businesses to access global capital markets in the future.
Against this backdrop, this article examines and estimates the possible regulatory stance of Chinese policymakers towards this winding-up order in Hong Kong. This article is composed of four parts. After this introduction, Part Two elaborates on what th""","""In conclusion, whether or to what extent this winding-up order will be enforced will be a test of how far the Chinese policymakers are willing to go to tackle the cross-border debt default of Chinese enterprises. The first two parts analyses the nature of the ongoing Evergrande debt crisis, finding The Chinese central government does not seem to regard Evergrande as too big to fail. Instead, it sees runaway debt and leverage in the real estate sector as a life-and-death risk for China's overall economic health. Meanwhile, the Chinese central government sees the ongoing Evergrande debt crisis as a controlled implosion, provided that Evergrande goes through a slow insolvency or orderly restructuring under strict government control. It appears willing to reduce over-reliance on the previous growth engine at the cost of the economic pain caused by some real estate giants.
The fourth part explores the cross-border insolvency solution to the Evergrande debt crisis by answering two questions. The first question is to discuss the legal basis for Hong Kong liquidators seeking recognition of insolvency proceedings in the Mainland China.

The international community therefore agreed to transition away from coal to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 and remain within the temperature limits set under international law. However, phasing out existing coal power stations can conflict with international investment protection treaties. Recent arbitration claims against the United States, Canada, and European coun- tries show how foreign investors can challenge climate measures before international tribunals and threaten to paralyze the ambitious actions needed to address climate change. As a key financier of coal power infrastructure, China plays a crucial role in the global transition away from coal. Besides China's domestic reliance on coal, its companies have heavily invested in coal power overseas, particularly in Asia. Taking into account the threat of investment arbitration to climate reg- ulation, a crucial question therefore is whether foreign investors, for example from China, could slow down Asia's energy transition by challenging coal phase-out decisions before international arbitration?","Given China's role in overseas coal power investments and the risk of invest-
ment arbitration facing phase-out decisions, China's position on the tension
between investment protection and climate regulation is relevant for the global
transition away from coal. Major hosts of Chinese coal power investments have
announced their intention to phase down coal power on their territory, but the
requirement to compensate investors for these stranded assets could jeopardize
the implementation of these decisions.
In theory, Chinese investment treaties provide legal grounds to investors to seek,
and potentially obtain, significant damages for the closure of their installations.
Following the international trend, China included environmental exceptions in its
recent investment treaties. However, arbitral practice on these exceptions has shown
limits to their effectiveness in safeguarding states' regulatory powers. Although
there are strong arguments for host states to justify ambitious climate regulation
under international investment law, the unpredictable interpretation and application
of investment treaties by arbitral tribunals exposes states to sizeable financial risks.
Given the difficulty in formulating effective exceptions protecting states' regu-
latory powers to adopt climate measures, alternative approaches to facilitate the
transition away from coal are needed. First, building on the recent attempt to
modernize the Energy Charter Treaty, China and its partners could incorporate a
coal power, or fossil fuel, carve-out in their investment treaties, thereby allowing
host states to exclude investment protection for coal power after a ten-year transi-
tion period. Second, China could help prevent arbitration claims against phase-
out decisions by requiring Chinese investors to strictly comply with the climate
laws of the states where they invest. This approach is already recognized under
China's existing environmental regulation of overseas investments. To address
the threat of arbitration to coal phase out, the ""host country"" principle could now
be established as a binding requirement to be enforced by the government.
In sum, tackling foreign investors' global carbon footprint while preventing
the threat of investment arbitration does not only depend on sound investment
treaty reforms, but also on the home state's domestic regulation of its overseas investments. Not only the host state, but also the home state government has a
role to play in facilitating the energy transition of its investment partners, and
thereby catalyzing further urgent fossil phase-out initiatives mired by the
investment-climate tension.",N,"Taking into account the threat of investment arbitration to climate regulation, a crucial question therefore is whether foreign investors, for example from China, could slow down Asia??s energy transition by challenging coal phase-out decisions before international arbitration?","Based on recent arbitral practice, the analysis demonstrates the limited effectiveness of these environmental exceptions in neutralizing arbitration challenges against phase-out decisions. Given the unpredictable interpretation of environmental exceptions by arbitral tribunals, the article emphasizes the need to exclude coal power from international investment protection. It also points to the role of home state governments in addressing the carbon footprint of the investments made by their nationals abroad.

One baseline assumption is that the police use necessary means, including the use of torture to extract confessions, to get to the bottom of the truth so that criminals are punished. Despite being cruel, illegal, and possibly yielding false confessions, the use of torture may be justified for the truth-finding purpose. However, when the police know they do not have sufficient evidence (even with ones confession), yet decide to alter and/or fabricate evidence, or to hide exculpatory evidence from the prosecutor and the judge, their primary goal is no longer for truth-finding, but achieving finality. In other words, when police tamper with evidence, they no longer care about the truth (e.g., whether the accused was the one who committed the crime), but merely aim to close the case. Our data showed, in approximately three-fourths of these exonerated death penalty cases, police tampered with evidence, and this pattern holds true across different eras. After decades of legal reforms, unfortunately, the Chinese criminal justice system remains crime control oriented, inquisitorial in nature, albeit the defense is slowly gaining some power.

Readers must be cautioned that our samples involved only exonerated capital cases, which may expose police abuse in its worst forms. Our analysis nevertheless sheds light on some of the fundamental issues faced by the Chinese criminal justice system. If these high-profile death penalty cases had difficulties in having their errors detected and corrected, it would have been worse for relatively minor cases which would have more difficulty to have their grievances heard. Major implications for relevant confession laws and practices are summarized below.

First, effective measures should be taken to curb heavy reliance on confession as sole or primary evidence in conviction. The current CPL made it clear that confession evidence alone is insufficient for conviction (Article 55). To reduce police incentives in obtaining confessions at all costs, several improvements should be made, including (1) the law should exclude illegally collected evidence that would otherwise not be discoverable, regardless of whether the evidence is corroborated or not (in contrast, under the current exclusionary rule, illegal obtained physical evidence may still be used so long as they are verified or justified, Article 55); and (2) evidentiary chain must be established and rigorously contested. This requires that police officers have the competence and skills to collect, analyze, and present evidence, police departments have sufficient resources for equipment and testing, and the defense has access to full evidentiary files and independent forensic experts. In She Xianglin case, for example, She requested the police perform DNA tests on the dead body, who was mistakenly identified as his missing wife. The police replied that DNA testing was too expensive, who would pay for it? (Li, 2015:1). At the same time, it should be pointed out that scientific tests could contain errors and are subject to human interpretations. In Nian Bin case, for example, but for the defenses ability to hire their own forensic experts to challenge the states forensic test results, Nian would not have been exonerated (Li, 2015).

Second, the use of torture should be prevented, detected, and punished. Currently, torture resulting in physical injury or death carries criminal liability, and the burden of proof lies with the accused who must undergo a physical examination by the state-designated hospitals, which could raise issues about the credibility of the test results. Instead, the burden should be reversed and fall on the police to prove no torture (Chen, 2006). In addition, a review for potential torture should be activated when during an interrogation; there is a death non-self-inflicted bodily injury, excessive length of detention, or a failure to notify family and lawyers about ones detention and interrogation (He, 2009). Furthermore, our data showed that interrogations were overwhelmingly conducted at a local police station or police bureau, and few were recorded and in lawyers presence. The current CPL stipulates interrogations be conducted at a detention center after a suspect was sent to the detention center, and the suspect is entitled to hire a lawyer at the first interrogation session or on the first day in police custody, and interrogation of major (including life or death penalty cases) cases be recorded in its entirety (Articles 118, 34, 123). The CPL also stipulated that the legal aid office may appoint in-house counsel at local courts and detention centers to provide legal service to criminal suspects (Article 36). We suggest that over time, every detention center should have in-house counsel service, and interrogation sessions must be recorded with a lawyer present who signs off the recording as part of the case record. Granted, it would involve high costs and logistics that could take years to materialize. Chen (2006) further suggested restructuring detention centers as independent unit housed under the Department of Justice instead of the public security bureaus to ensure the integrity of an interrogation. More importantly, claims of police abuse must be allowed to go through a more formalized procedure and be examined by an independent judiciary.

It is expected to see the extremely high confession rate and torture in our samples because they involve wrongfully convicted death penalty cases. Nevertheless, there is a general consensus among China legal scholars that police torture is widespread and coerced confession rate is rather high even among non-capital, ordinary cases (Bi, 2007; Zuo, 2005). Wu and Vander Beken (2010) attributed the high rates in torture and confession to a number of factors, including political (e.g., crime fighting as a political mandate), cultural (e.g., the influence of Confucianism and communitarianism), legal (e.g., lack of procedural safeguards in preventing police abuse such as the presence of legal counsel during interrogations, and ones right to remain silent), and institutional reasons (e.g., low police budget, high workload and pressure, lack of competence and technology, lack of transparency and checks and balances). Tackling so many factors simultaneously is not an easy task.

Third, an effective error correction system should be established. The existing accountability system seems to suffer a dilemma: on the one hand, it seems to focus heavily on finding individual faults, rather than improving the systems integrity, thus reducing stakeholders incentives of self-corrections (as evident in the Nie Shubin case). On the other hand, once an error was discovered, the punishment was seemingly allocated haphazardly and indiscriminately (as seen in Huugjilts case), and it was unclear what specific action was sanctioned and how responsibilities/punishment were assessed and determined. The Nian Bin case is another example here: besides the chief police officer who used torture and was blamed as the main culprit for Nians wrongful conviction, none of the prosecutors, forensic experts, or lower court judges was assessed of their responsibilities in mishandling the case, and no other related personnel was sanctioned.

In addition, in reviewing these cases, we could not identify clear procedural rules regarding the petition and review process for those who protest wrongful convictions; and the review process took years and often witnessed unexpected twists and turns depending on the players involved. Indeed, our data showed that only 20% of the police officers with misconduct received any punishment, and few upper echelon officials received meaningful sanctions. In terms of identifying systemic flaws and proposing steps to curb similar mistakes in the future, few concrete actions were derived from these tragic errors, albeit progress has been made with amendments in the CPL over the years.

We suggest that error detection and correction mechanisms focus primarily on systemic errors to improve the system and prevent future errors, instead of finding individual faults. When individuals violate the law, they should have due process protections and be given an opportunity to explain and defend their actions. Only with a fair process and proper goals would legal officers have the incentives to identify and correct errors, rather than covering them up. Granted, in instances of intentional, serious violations of laws, officers should be held accountable for their actions, but the details of their actions and laws applied must be clearly stipulated to establish transparency and credibility. Only under these circumstances is it likely that individual law enforcement officers would operate professionally, with dignity and courage to make the best decisions.

Last but not the least, law enforcement works shall be independent of political and populous demand and pressure. A political mandate such as ??all murders must be solved?? goes against the science of criminal investigation and raises unfulfillable expectations of the victim??s family.

There is a need to set up a new foundation on which an intelligent society can build steady and lasting progress.","An intelligent society comes soon enough and highlights the urgent nature of ""constructing legal order"" for this intelligent society. This construction is a scientific proposition, a theme of the times, and a research topic. We must guide and regulate the intelligent technology revolution with rationality, virtue and strength of the rule-of-law, make the intelligent system safer and more controllable, and make its technical application more ethical and rational, so that the intelligent system can become the productivity basis for promoting the well-regulated, sharing, equitable and harmonious social development. Only when we have reasonable and sufficient expectations for our privacy protection, peace in life and freedom of mind, can we really get fair rules, fair rights and fair opportunities relating to algorithm decision-making and machine decisionmaking. Only when scientificness, human-centeredness, justice, inclusiveness and cogovernance are listed as core elements of jurisprudential order, can intelligent online education, intelligent telemedicine, intelligent barrier-free facilities, remote legal services, intelligent social governance and internet justice play positive roles. It is these roles that unleash positive energy, help narrow the economic gap between people, reduce regional imbalance and make up for the current situation of insufficient supply and uneven sharing of all kinds of high-quality resources. We will better realize digital justice, educational equity, medical equity, judicial equity, and public services equality, and better safeguard the rights and interests of socially vulnerable groups such as the ill, the elderly, the disabled, the wounded, and the poor, so that all people can share the fruits of technological development under the legal order of the intelligent society, and realize the all-round development of people and social progress.

to regulating abortion in China. Men seek to control womens reproductive autonomy and
use the courts to do so. Chinese courts have not only served as unexpected fora for contesting
reproduction, but have also played an indirect role in regulating abortion by ignoring, legitimizing, and occasionally rewarding men's claims. Our findings paint a picture of how
persistent male claims to control women's reproduction can be, how and why women and
their lawyers often fail to raise legal objections to such claims, and how legal institutions
often bend or ignore the law in favor of deep-rooted cultural norms. As China emerges from
an era in which the state coercively administered contraception, sterilization, and abortion,
the relaxation of birth regulation does not necessarily equate to greater freedom for women.
In addition, as the Chinese Party-state increasingly embraces pro-birth policies, the Party-
state seems likely to rely on a combination of cultural norms and private law enforcement

This paper examines how members of an online public, the Tianya Forum, concep- tualized and discussed law in relation to a specific event, the 2008 Sanlu milk scandal. Whereas previous studies suggest the Chinese state effec- tively controls citizens' legal consciousness via propaganda, this analysis shows that the construction of legality by the Tianya public was not a top- down process, but a complex negotiation involving multiple parties. The Chinese state had to compete with lawyers and outspoken media to frame and interpret the scandal for the Tianya public and it was not always successful in doing so. Data show further how the online public framed the food safety incident as indicative of fundamental problems rooted in China's political regime and critiqued the state's instrumental use of law.","Literature on legality and legal consciousness suggests that the Chinese state controls the construction of legality via state propaganda, and is able to shape citizens legal consciousness given most peoples lack of direct experience with the law. (Gallagher 2006; Liebman 2011a: 183; Michelson and Read 2011, Stockmann and Gallagher 2011; Su and He 2010: 163). Our findings, however, suggest that the construction of legality is not a top-down process wholly controlled by the authoritarian state, but rather a complex negotiation involving multiple parties. Participants in Tianya were unconvinced by and openly critical of official state discourse. The participants exposure to the voices of volunteer lawyers, NGOs, parents of victimsmainly through the mediation of relatively outspoken newspapers and online news
websitesas well as their own discussions in Tianya influenced how they constructed problems associated with the Sanlu scandal and legality.
As our analysis has shown, the Party-states official discourse constructed problems narrowly, downplaying the Sanlu scandal as simply a food safety incident. The legality constructed in official discourse is a top-down and paternalistic order carefully orchestrated by the Party-state. According to this narrative, the benevolent state knows exactly what the problems are and what is best for citizens. It uses law to tackle food safety problems, punish wrongdoers, and protect citizens, while also improving legal norms and institutions to make them better instruments for governance. Under such legality, the purpose of law is to create the kind of order desirable for the state. What is missing from the official discourse, however, is any kind of participatory role for non-state actors, such as citizens and lawyers, to help shape
legal norms, choose the kind of legal institutions they want to use, and oversee the implementation of law.

There are at least two explanations for this decline. First, in an authoritarian system, officials tend to exercise arbitrary power as a convenient means to not only exert political control but also address governance issues ?C?C?C they may benefit personally from such actions as well. Second, China's partial legal rationality has been mainly maintained through self-restraint by the Communist Party in the post-Mao era. As this self-restraint weakens, both political and non-political spheres are increasingly vulnerable to arbitrary power of dominant officials.","No Conclusion but the final section is: Lessons from Continued Systemic Failures
In this study, we focused on systemic failures reflected in the Cui Ning case and four contemporary cases and emphasized the continuation of such failures despite passage of time. Before we draw some lessons, wed like to point out two caveats. First, the four selected cases are not an anomaly of Chinas modern practice. Problems identified in these cases typified cases in the 1980s and 1990s, and these problems continued among cases exposed in the new century (e.g., Zhang Yuhuan). For instance, after four death sentences in eight years, Nian Bin was acquitted in 2014 for an alleged double-murder in 2006. All systemic failures discussed were readily evident in Nians case (Lu et al., 2019). Second, as Jiang (2016b, 300301) pointed out, Chinas law and practice tend to define the scope of wrongful convictions narrowly (limited to errors in facts or in convictions). Plus the extreme difficulty in proving wrongful convictions short of windfalls, these exposed cases represent the tip of an iceberg.

This study contributes to our understanding of Chinas wrongful conviction in two ways: first, it adds to a small body of English literature on this topic, which would allow access to overseas audience. Second, albeit these systemic failures in contemporary cases have been well documented in the last two decades, our effort to match these failures with that of the Cui Ning case from hundreds of years ago is novel, which makes us reflect upon the continuation of these failures. The attempt to connect the disjunction between studies of historical and contemporary wrongful conviction cases, we contend, deserves more academic and practical attention through domestic and international comparisons. To draw critical lessons, it is helpful to examine the continuation from two angles, from efforts within China and from an international comparison.

Within China, it should be acknowledged that China has made significant progress in the past four decades to improve its criminal justice system. Since their inception in 1979, the Criminal Law has already been amended eleven times (the latest in 2020) and the CPL three times (the latest in 2018). Facing challenge of wrongful convictions in particular, a series of laws and regulations have been adopted to tackle problems exposed. In 2010, for example, two new evidence rules were jointly issued by five government branches, including the Rules on Certain Issues Relating to Examining and Judging Evidence in Death Penalty Cases and Rules on Certain Issues Relating to the Exclusion of Illegal Evidence in Criminal Cases. Hailed as the exclusionary rule, they were integrated into the amended CPL in 2012. In 2013, guidelines and provisions regarding prevention of wrongful convictions were adopted by the Central Committee of the CCP and other criminal justice branches to emphasize presumption of innocence and establish mechanisms that potentially curb wrongful convictions (Xiong & Miao, 2018). Some measures to correct wrongful convictions in individual cases such as the change of venue to allow the retrial of Nies case were also acclaimed as breakthroughs (Fang & Li, 2017). Additionally, Chinese legal scholars called for more drastic measures such as the right to remain silent, presence of lawyers during police interrogation, and more effective exclusionary rules (He & He, 2008; Jiang, 2014).

Nevertheless, serious doubts still exist on the effectiveness of these reform measures for two primary reasons. First, being compromised by concerns about crime control, many of the adopted measures are incomplete and insufficient to counter systemic failures (Jiang, 2015, 2018). For instance, the adopted exclusionary rule leaves ample room for the authorities to admit physical and documentary evidence obtained by illegal means such as torture (Chen, 2011; Lewis, 2011). Second, in practice, the police still find ways to circumvent legal stipulations. In the Nian Bin case, the police managed to edit the recording tape and showed flawless interrogation in court, despite the requirement that interrogation be audio or video-recorded in its entirety (Lu et al., 2019). Indeed, the recordings of interrogations are often utilized by the police to counter torture claims by criminal suspects/defendants, and even as a tool for hiding or encouraging torture (Jiang, 2018).

As shown, wrongful conviction in China is very convoluted and its dominant features continued despite modernization of Chinas criminal justice system. The cultural and traditional notion of presumption of guilt, tolerance of use of torture, the publics willingness to intervene and influence the outcome of individual cases, lack of effective criminal defense, and lack of checks and balances among the gong-jian-fa all play a role and aggravate the problems. It is the hard-to-change nature of the Chinese wrongful convictions that presents the most challenge in our opinion. While to fully account for such continuation of systemic failures is complicated and warrants more scholarly attention, we suggest that at least two potential directions, inter-related, should be explored. First, we argue that there lacked fundamental changes to Chinas criminal litigation model. Despite passage of time and a modernized system, a criminal justice system driven by predominantly a crime control model with insufficient due process protections and poor mechanisms of checks and balances (e.g., weak criminal defense, the assembly-line workstyle of the gong-jian-fa) is likely to be error-prone, especially when institutional and political pressure and incentives are set to capture criminals by all means and appease the masses. Second, the functioning of the criminal justice system needs to be examined under the influence of Chinas political and cultural context. For instance, Xia (2011) explored from a philosophical perspective why torture remains acceptable to many people (including authorities such as the police) in China despite the fact that it has been outlawed. Xia argued that it is utilitarianism culturally and politically embraced by the government and the masses that justifies the use of torture against the bad people (or as a small sacrifice in case of the innocent) for the greater public goods. Thus, despite the official calls to balance fighting crimes and protecting human rights, the balance is always tipped toward the former. In his study of legal and political rights advocacy in wrongful conviction cases, Jiang (2016a) echoed Xias argument and extended it to Chinas political system. As Jiang argued, when torture and wrongful conviction cases are exposed, the authorities would tolerate such discussions as long as these problems are portrayed as merely individual, which justifies calling for more supervision and stricter disciplinary mechanisms to eradicate the bad apples of the gong-jian-fa. However, when the legal advocacy for correcting wrongful conviction cases expands and turns into a fight against institutional faults and calls for more citizens rights, it poses a potential threat to the governments authoritarian rule and control based on utilitarianism. Such progressive advocacy is very unlikely to be incorporated in the government initiated, top-down reforms and could even face persecutions. More future study is necessary to examine the influence of China??s polity (authoritarian in nature with little change) and culture (e.g., utilitarianism, paternalism) on the criminal justice system and its practice.

An international comparative perspective also sheds invaluable light. On the one hand, scholars showed that many causes of China??s wrongful convictions are similar to that of other nations such as police misconduct, torture, false confession, false witness testimony, and false expert testimony (He, 2016; Huang, 2012; Jiang, 2016b) and China??s use of torture was comparable to the American experience in the 1920s and 1930s (Belkin, 2011). Nevertheless, we argue that these comparisons often failed to take into consideration fundamental features of China??s case that refused to change overtime. Under the surface of common causes lie some unique Chinese ??characteristics?? that lay the foundation for systemic failures of the Chinese criminal justice system (He, 2014b). For instance, be",NA,"In this study, we draw parallels between wrongful convictions in the past and in theexisting Chinese criminal justice system. We argue that there is continuity of systemic failuresdespite passage of time. Specifically, we identify five systemic failures in a famousstory, the wrongful execution of Cui Ning (cuozhan Cui Ning), from the Song dynasty(960?C1279), and contrast them with four contemporary cases to examine the continuationof such failures.","On feasibility of studying the death penalty:

A comparative analysis of the models of the U.S. and China sheds light on this question. The early American states established their patent systems before the formation of the federal system, but the U.S. Constitution arrogated patent legislative power to the federal government, ending the era of decentralized patent systems. This centralized structure ensures uniformity in rules but might binder the system's adaptability and ability to experiment. In contrast, as China's patent system evolved, its patent legislative power spread from the central to the local governments. This shift led to the coexistence of dual-level patent legislative structure. Currently, twenty-nine out of thirty- one province-level authorities (93.5%) and twenty-one out of 323 city-level authorities with local Legislative power (6.5%) have established local patent laws. China's patent system is not entirely decentralized but rather, semi-decentralized, as the locales not only implement their local patent laws but also must enforce the central government's national patent laws. China's semi- decentralized patent legislation model embodies significant features of cooperative federalism, where the central and local governments share the national power to handle affairs and collaborate to address issues. Yet, the central government maintains a dominant position in this cooperative relationship, as a consequence of China's unitary state structure. Compared to the current centralized patent legislation model in the U.S., China's semi-decentralized patent legislation model has the advantage of making statutory law more adaptable to local specificities and promoting local competition and institutional innovation. However, it also faces challenges, such as increased costs due to inconsistency; efficiency decline stemming from rent-seeking behaviors; and the risk that local protectionism will create anti-competitive effects.","This Article compares the patent legislative power allocation models in China and the U.S. In terms of evolutionary paths, the U.S. transitioned from a decentralized model where patent legislative power resided with the states, to a centralized model which consolidated this power at the federal level. Within the realm of patent legislation, there is no collaboration between the federal and state governments. Conversely, China moved from a centralized model, where patent legislative power was concentrated in the central government, to a semi- decentralized model, with coexistence between the patent legislative power of the central and local governments. This Article posits that China's semi-decentralized patent legislation model manifests key elements of cooperative federalism, embodying power sharing between central and local governments as they collaboratively address issues related to innovation. However, the nature of the cooperation between China's central and local governments is distinctive. Unlike the U.S. federal system, where states enjoy significant autonomy, China's central government assumes a dominant role, a consequence of its unitary state structure. Local governments supplement the central government's constructed system by further developing it, tailoring it to local conditions under the central government's guidance and supervision. Compared to the current centralized patent legislation model in the U.S., this Article suggests that the intricate structure of a semi-decentralized patent legislation model might be better equipped to cater to the diverse needs of local industries and inventor communities, and to spur local competition and institutional innovation. It can do this while complying with international treaty requirements, given that national patent laws maintain a level of protection no lower than these treaties necessitate and that local patent laws do not decrease the protection level of the national laws. However, the model also faces challenges regarding potential inconsistency, rent-seeking behaviors, and local protectionism. Chas journal o international tow The examination of this semi-decentralized patent legislation model opens new avenues for understanding legislative diversity, stimulating further scholarly discourse.

Penn. Asian L. Rev. 372 (2024)",University of Pennsylvania Asian Law Review,https://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/alr/vol19/iss3/1/,,"As the world's second-largest economy, China has become a critical venue for high-profile cross-border insolvency proceedings in recent years. The evolution of China's insolvency law and the pertinent judicial practice, especially its cross-border aspects, remains in infancy. This development underscores the significance of the 2021 Arrangement between Mainland China and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (Hong Kong SAR) on cross-border insolvency cooperation (the 2021 Arrangement). The Arrangement not only caters to the unique demands under the One Country, Two Systems policy but also incorporates legal advancements and institutional features from the 1997 United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency (MLCBI) and the 2015 Recast of European Union (EU) Regulation on Insolvency Proceedings. Therefore, the 2021 Arrangement signifies a crucial step forward in legal cooperation between Mainland China and Hong Kong SAR, highlighting the expanding legal interconnections between China, Hong Kong SAR, and the international community in the field of cross-border insolvency.
However, the judicial practice under the 2021 Arrangement since its enactment, especially its sparse utilization by Mainland judges, suggests that it has not achieved its intended objectives. A variety of factors contribute to the lack of effective and meaningful cooperation. Against this backdrop, the article begins by detailing the Arrangem","For decades, the dynamic between Mainland China and Hong Kong in addressing cross-border insolvency has been underdeveloped. It is universally acknowledged that forging an effective and efficient partnership in this domain holds the key to nurturing a conducive business environment across both Mainland China and Hong Kong. The establishment of a formal mechanism for mutual recognition and assistance is critical in safeguarding legal interests and mitigating the uncertainties inherent in cross- border insolvency scenarios. With this objective, the 2021 Arrangement has been crafted to refine the cross-border insolvency proceedings, offering a structured approach to bolster cooperation between the two regions. Thus, the Arrangement marks a substantial advancement, playing a vital role in fortifying the market economy and propelling economic growth. Almost three years after the introduction of the 2021 Arrangement, its implementation has been less effective than anticipated, due to factors including its underutilization and communication gaps, among others. Given the closer business ties between Hong Kong and cities in mainland China, it remains to be seen whether the 2021 Arrangement can serve as a useful and practical solution to facilitate more efficient cross-border corporate restructuring actions and expand beyond the three pilot cities to other major cities in mainland China. Looking at successful international cooperation mechanisms, it's evident that there's a pressing need for both jurisdictions to embrace the UNCITRAL MLCBI, improve communication channels, and increase procedural transparency to facilitate more effective cross-border insolvency cooperation. The recommendations proposed in this article aim to overcome existing obstacles and improve the framework for cross- border insolvency cooperation between the two jurisdictions.","

Data localization regulations require certain data to be stored within national borders.4 Although China is not the only country with data localization requirements,5 it receives overwhelming attention because of its authoritarian status and concerning lack of human rights protections. It is not surprising that when speaking of data localization, people may first think it is a method that authoritarian countries use to manipulate their citizens. In fact, data localization, or similar regulations, has been adopted in many countries (as explained below), and many of them are *184 considered relatively liberal. Different countries have distinct rationales for adopting data localization rules. For example, as shown below, countries may impose data localization restrictions to benefit local economies, defend national security, and protect human rights. However, data localization rules are controversial because they can be a double-edged sword. They have destructive potential to damage information security and impede human rights to free access to information and privacy.

From the exploration of the data localization restrictions, it is safe to conclude that sometimes countries have legitimate reasons to restrict data flow, especially for cross-border data transfer, even though data localization regulation itself is controversial. Therefore, the most acute issue for data localization is how authoritarian countries can be restrained from exploiting the data they collect. To address this issue, an intergovernmental organization should be established to monitor data usage among countries and provide a neutral platform to resolve disputes related to potential data exploitation.",,"Therefore, this article is intended to dig deeper into global data localization measures and how data localization policies may be regulated in a global context.","Different countries have distinct rationales for adopting data localization rules??

We find that marital or domestic violence, offender's guilty conscience or forgiveness by victim's family, and insufficient heinousness underline the disapproval patterns. In contrast, large number of victims or victim deaths, use of weapon, brutal crime nature, being a ringleader in violent crimes, and significant drug weight in drug crimes describe the approval patterns with a general lack of recognition for mitigating circumstances. However, significant variations existed among approved cases, involving defendants who caused a single death for domestic or marital dispute, had no criminal record, committed a crime of passion, or carried low-purity drugs or acted as drug mules. These variations raise the question of whether the Supreme People's Court maintains a consistent standard following its own guidelines.","To summarize, this study shows considerable variations among SPC's DSRs, and there is still a long way to go to fulfill the policy of ""killing fewer"" instructed by SPC's official slogan. Note that DSR must be advised by SPC Adjudication Committee in some cases, which we cannot observe from the published TDSRs.49 By any means, the SPC should keep improving the consistency of its decisions and making the use of death sentences more predictable.

We caution the reader regarding the lack of generalizability of our data. TDPRs utilized in this study were not complete collections of all death sentenced cases in the related years or from a certain jurisdiction. We also acknowledge the methodological limitations of descriptive analysis due to limitation of data in current reality. More inferential statistical analysis (e.g., multivariate analysis) would be helpful in the [End Page 159] future once more data becomes available. Fully acknowledging these caveats, we argue that the wide range of cases in our sample allows a limited but meaningful analysis of the DSR decision patterns and the extent of their variations, which is not achieved in previous studies, thus our unique contribution to the readership of death sentence in China. We believe that the results of our study shed light on our understanding the DSR process, particularly through analyzing cases that are comparable based on legal factors such as the type of offense, the level of harm, and the background of the offender. The identified deviations from SPC guidelines could be a starting point for review of actual DSR practices and potential policy changes to further calibrate the death sentencing process in China. Given the finding that even elite SPC judges struggled to maintain uniform and consistent standards in DSR, one critical step would be to revise the relevant content of the CL to better guide judicial decisions from meting out death sentences.

The target of trust in the country is the Centre, which is ultimately the top leader. The critical issue domain for assessing the Centre's trustworthiness is policy implementation rather than policymaking. The Centre's trustworthiness has two dimensions: commitment to good governance and the capacity to discipline local officials. Observed trust in the central government indicates trust in the Centre's commitment, while observed trust in the local government reflects confidence in the Centre's capacity. A machine learning analysis of a national survey reveals how much conventional reading overestimates political trust. At first glance, 85 per cent of the respondents trust the central government. Upon further inspection, 18 per cent have total trust in the Centre, 34 per cent have partial trust and 33 per cent are sceptical.","This paper proposes a new interpretation of survey findings of trust in government in China. The new measurement scheme treats the observed trust in the central government as an indicator of trust in the Centres commitment and treats the observed trust in the local government as a reflection of confidence in the Centres capacity. The study shows that the conventional reading of the national survey results considerably overestimates political trust in the authoritarian regime because it mistakes the observed trust in the central government for latent trust in the Centre. It is true that the vast majority of the population trust the central government; however, closer inspection shows that only about one-fifth of the population are confident about the Centres commitment and capacity, one-third trust its commitment without the matching confidence about capacity, another third are sceptical about both, and nearly 15 per cent are distrustful of both. For scholars, the finding paves the way for exploring sources and implications of trust in the Centre. For policy analysts, the study suggests an innovative approach to obtaining a more accurate assessment of the authoritarian regimes soft power. The study highlights the importance of contextualization for optimizing conceptual equivalence, which is critical to avoid concept stretching in comparative political studies. Contextualizing a concept involves profiling its genetic structure in light of its specific context of origin. Applying a concept requires matching the genetic profile of a member of the conceptual family in a different setting with that of the prototype. In the comparative study of political trust, the prototype of trust in government can be traced back to John Locke??s social contract theory on the one hand and the practice of representative democracy and the rule of law on the other hand. In a democracy with the rule of law, the target of trust is an elected political institution that is simultaneously responsible for legislation and administration. The critical issue domain is law-making, and the distinction of commitment and capacity applies primarily to individual politicians. The study shows that political trust in China belongs to the family of political trust, but it has distinctive characteristics.

It joins recent efforts to analyze labor processes and contention in the platform economy (e.g., Tassinari and Maccarrone 2017, 2020). Building on literature that suggests researchers should incorporate data about managements perspective in analyzing labor processes in the platform economy (Veen et al. 2019), I examined a variety of data, including interviews with workers, management personnel, a lawyer, and an engineer. As such, this article provides a multi-perspective account of how platform companies and their franchisees control and manage the labor process. Specifically, I demonstrated how platform architecturetechnological, legal, and organizational dimensions of control and managementinfluences labor process and critical mechanisms for collective contention. I also showed that when different dimensions of control reinforce each other in escalating grievances and perceived injustice, and increase the appeal of and spaces for collective action, moments of collective action and solidarity are more likely to emerge.
Before discussing the contribution of this study, I first address two analytic issues. The first concerns the 87 cases of collective action. As mentioned previously, the data are limited in their exhaustiveness. To strengthen the reliability of my analysis, I examined the 87 cases along with interviews with couriers and management personnel. Results from the three data sources are consistent. Data triangulation thus strengthens the reliability of my findings. The second issue is a partial alternative explanation. As mentioned, some GPCs worked first as SPCs and switched to the gig platform once they became more familiar with their local area. This suggests SPCs and GPCs might have different skill levels or characteristics due to the self-selection process. As shown in Table 1, SPC and GPC interviewees had similar demographic characteristics and prior employment history. Furthermore, after careful examination of the data, I did not find SPCs and GPCs had different capabilities to participate in collective contention. In short, evidence does not support the alternative explanation.
This study makes three major contributions. First, it proposes the theoretical concept of platform architecture to capture not only the technological but also the legal and organizational aspects of labor control and management, as well as the relationship among these different dimensions of control. As such, the study deepens extant scholarship that focuses on algorithmic control and management (Goods et al. 2019; Griesbach et al. 2019; Rosenblat 2018; Rosenblat and Stark 2016; Wood et al. 2019) and sheds light on the variable ways these distinct dimensions of control and management operate, interact, and shape the labor process jointly.
Second, the study demonstrates and explains emergent collective action and solidarity in an unlikely setting. Recent scholarship suggests work relations under platform economies can be analyzed through the lens of labor process theory (Veen et al. 2019). Although labor process theory is insightful for analyzing control and management, it does not provide a comprehensive framework for analyzing workers responses, especially how workers construct and react to grievances. This study contributes to the literature by integrating labor process theory with sociolegal studies and literature on collective action. As such, this theoretical framework can help analyze how the technical, legal, and organizational dimensions of platform architecture shape collective resistance through influencing the construction of grievances, the appeal of collective contention vis-?-vis other responses to grievances, and access to free spaces for collective action. Although work is atomized and workers share neither workspace nor employers within the gig platform (Webster 2016), I show how gig workers mobilize to contest gig platforms. Following literature that suggests we focus on moments of escalation (Atzeni 2009; Fantasia 1988), I demonstrate that when different dimensions of control reinforce each other, moments of escalation are more likely to evolve into moments of collectivism and solidarity.
My findings contribute to a more nuanced understanding of the emergence and characteristics of solidarity in the platform economy. Similar to Tassinari and Maccarrones (2020) work, I find expressions of solidaritymostly, as couriers discuss similar grievances against platform companies in relatively free spaces, and subsequently participate in collective action. But I also examine the cross-cutting, uneven, and contested characteristics of such solidarity, which reveal both the potential and the limitations of solidarity. On the one hand, gig couriers working for one platform company can moblize support and solidarity from restaurant owners and couriers working for the other company. Such cross-cutting solidarity has not previously been documented by studies of collective action in the platform economy. I further provide evidence that some solidarity can prompt compromise from gig platform companies. On the other hand, my findings also reveal the uneven and contested nature of solidarity (Beck and Brook 2020; cf. Tassinari and Maccarrone 2020). I uncover variation among gig workers in terms of their solidarity with other workers and involvement in collective action. Indeed, core actors in collective action share strong solidarity and support. Beyond core actors, however, many GPCs are united only by their shared animosity to the platforms. As a result of shared sentiments, potential sanctions, and curiosity, many GPCs showed up at strikes or protest sites, but only as bystanders. Some non-participating gig workers even encountered threats and violence.
Third, my finding about the legal design of platforms goes beyond the conventional concern with the employee-versus-independent-contractor classification (Kenney and Zysman 2016; Vallas 2017; Veen et al. 2019). This study suggests the need to attend to how the enormous difference in contractual power between platforms and couriers intensifies couriers sense of injustice and exploitation. As such, it contributes to literature on the role of contractual relationships in the market economy (Suchman 2003).
Questions might arise as to why employment classification is not a major concern for couriers in China, considering it is often an important issue in other contexts (Kenney and Zysman 2016). In China, one major difference between workers with and without an employee status is that the former are entitled to social insurance protection according to labor law, but the latter are not. Given the weak enforcement of labor law in China (Gallagher 2017), both SPCs and GPCs understood that employers in the service sector rarely purchase social insurance for workers. Therefore, SPCs did not expect to have social insurance, despite their employee status. Given this absence of a real difference between SPCs and GPCs in terms of social insurance, GPCs were not focused on employment classification.
What mattered more in grievance construction was how couriers perceived the predictability and fairness of their legal relationships. Under the service platform, labor contracts help stabilize labor relations. SPCs have clear expectations and feel their employers are constrained by contractual terms and labor law, at least regarding salary. Therefore, SPCs injustice and collective action frames only reveal a legal contradictionthe violation of contractual terms or labor law. No one challenges the legitimacy of the legal order based on contracts and labor law. In contrast, under the gig platform, the contractual design enables intense algorithmic control and management by giving platforms unbridled legal and technological power. Legal scholars have been long concerned with the problems associated with clickwrap agreements (Hubley 2016; Smith 2016) and asymmetric contracts (Roppo 2009). My analysis shows that when gig platforms exercise their unbridled contractual power to change platform rules, workers not only discern this power but also consider it and the rules made by such power to be despotic. Importantly, GPCs can mobilize restaurant owners and GPCs who work for the other gig platform to join collective action because they all suffer alike from asymmetric contractual power and share similar injustice frames. This finding is relevant beyond the Chinese context. As Stewart and Stanford (2017) point out, Uber has a similar contractual design with couriers in Australia. In addition, Uber Eats and Grubhub in the United States have leveraged their market and contractual power to charge restaurants increasing commission fees.7 ","platform economy, labor control, collective action, grievance, gig platform, technology, law, China",this study asks how and when labor control and management leads to collective resistance in the platform economy.,"I argue that specific differences in platform architecture diffuse or heighten collective contention. Within the service platform, technological control and management generates work dissatisfaction, but the legal and organizational dimensions contain grievances and reduce the appeal of, and spaces for, collective contention. Conversely, within the gig platform, all three dimensions of platform architecture reinforce one another, escalating grievances, enhancing the appeal of collective contention, and providing spaces for mobilizing solidarity and collective action. As a result, gig platform couriers are more likely to consider their work relations exploitative and to mobilize contention, despite facing higher barriers to collective action due to the atomization of their work.",,Empirical (Qual),"Ethnography, interview, case study",N.

In author's words: The study design is a comparative analysis of work relations under two different types of food-delivery platforms??the service platform and the gig platform??each of which has a distinct platform architecture.

First, I conducted in-depth interviews with 30 SPCs and 30 GPCs in seven cities between 2018 and 2019. I recruited people who were couriers at the  time of the interview or in the preceding 12 months. Table 1 shows the distribution of these couriers. At the beginning of the study, I attempted to diversify the interviewee pool according to location, given the possibility of variation across cities in terms of how platforms operate and how couriers work. When it became clear there was no significant difference across cities, I did most of my interviews in Chongqing, a municipality in southwest China, given my access to research support there.  Interview questions included basic demographic information, employment history, work situation, interactions with other workers and supervisors, and experiences of strikes and protests. Many couriers shared their photos, videos, and social media communications with me, which helped me reconstruct collective action. Existing literature tends to neglect managements role (Veen et al. 2019), so I interviewed six people with management positions (four at service platforms, two at gig platforms). I also interviewed a system development engineer and an in-house lawyer to understand the technological and legal aspects of control and management. My assistants and I recorded and transcribed all 68 interviews.  Second, I conducted online ethnography between 2018 and 2019. I joined four nationwide discussion boards used by food-delivery couriers in Baidu Tieba, one of the largest online communities in China. I also joined 10 social media groups formed by couriers. I examined the Weibo content of certain couriers who organized or participated in strikes or protests. Online ethnography enabled me to reach out to participants in collective action. I read discussions, listened to couriers voice messages, and took notes and screenshots.  Third, I conducted on-the-ground ethnography in Chongqing. I began to conduct online ethnography with couriers in Chongqing two months before GPCs there organized a series of strikes and protests in May 2018. As Figure 1 shows, Chongqing is one of the many cities in which platform couriers staged collective action. I went to Chongqing in June 2018 to conduct fieldwork. When I arrived in Chongqing, many GPCs still had fresh memories of the collective action. I stayed in a plaza where gig couriers hung out and joined their conversations. One service platform station allowed me to observe their couriers and supervisors routines, and a gig platform manager allowed me to visit his office. After I left Chongqing,  I continued to observe the situation through follow-up interviews.  I analyzed and collected interview and ethnographic data iteratively, moving between data and theories. Initially, I designed my interview questions based on literature on algorithmic control. After conducting the first 20 interviews and some online ethnography, I began to analyze data. As a number of the emerging themes and codes did not appear in the literature on algorithmic control, my preliminary empirical analysis prompted me to develop a broader theoretical framework. I then revised my interview protocols based on the newly included literature. I did supplemental interviews with the first 20 interviewees and then conducted 48 more interviews. Fourth, I compiled a dataset that contains 87 cases of strikes or protests organized by food-delivery couriers between 2017 and 2018 in China. I use the term strike to mean a period of time during which people refuse to work; ??protest?? refers to the expression of opposition to something. All of the cases were both strikes and protests, as couriers not only refused to work but expressed their opposition to employers or platforms on banners or signs.

One area where disharmony exists pertains to the eligibility of biological subject matters for patents, such as disease treatment and diagnosis methods, animals and plants, genetic resources, and stem cells.4 Different countries have adopted varying approaches in this regard, influenced by their culture, customs, and developmental status. This disharmony allows countries to adopt IP regimes that align with their needs and socio-economic conditions. However, disharmony can create challenges for global companies, as they may have to navigate different patent laws and regulations in different countries to protect their interests. This is particularly true in the case of biological subject matters, as standards appear to differ from one jurisdiction to another. Given the United States' position as the largest global economy and China's emergence as the second largest economy, both countries hold significant roles in international business and intellectual property protection. The United States (U.S.) has raised concerns regarding inadequate protection of foreign intellectual property rights in China. However, the Chinese government has undertaken substantial efforts to enhance IP protection and align its patent system with international standards. It is important to recognize that China and the U.S. have distinct cultural and traditional backgrounds. China has a long-standing community-based culture and tradition that emphasizes social value and collective benefits.6 Conversely, the U.S. has a property rights-based culture and tradition that strongly emphasizes protecting and rewarding individual inventors and innovators. Therefore, conducting a comparative analysis of the treatment of biological subject matters in Chinese and U.S. patent law is valuable to understand how cultural, customary, and developmental differences influence their approaches to protecting such subject matters. This comparison can provide insights into the underlying rationale behind their choices and in exploring potential avenues for harmonizing the two patent systems. The first part of this paper will examine the divergent aspects of eligible biological subject matters in the Chinese and U.S. patent law systems. It will shed light on their respective approaches, focusing on areas such as methods of treating or diagnosing human and animal diseases, plants and animals, genetic resources, and human stem cells. An analysis *67 of these differences can give a better understanding of their contrasting approaches. The second part of the paper will delve into potential areas for harmonization that can promote global IP protection and facilitate innovation in biotechnology and related industries. Exploring opportunities for aligning the Chinese and U.S. patent systems will contribute to creating a more cohesive and efficient framework for biotechnological innovation on an international scale.","Disharmonies in intellectual property rights allow countries to explore and discover a balanced approach that protects inventions while accommodating their unique cultures, customs, and economic circumstances. As evidenced by the comparison between China and the U.S., each country has implemented patent laws tailored to its specific context, values, and goals, while also complying with its international treaties. China's exclusion of treatment and diagnosis methods from patent protection emphasizes the importance of accessibility to healthcare and collective well-being, promoting affordable options and preventing hindrance by patent monopolies. On the other hand, the U.S.'s allowance of patentability for these methods encourages medical innovation and provides incentives for research and development. Similarly, China's exclusion of animal and plant patentability is influenced by a complex interplay of cultural, customary, and developmental perspectives, prioritizing reverence for nature, traditional agricultural practices, and food security. While this may limit certain commercial opportunities, it underscores the importance of preserving cultural heritage, promoting shared benefits, and safeguarding access to genetic resources. The protection of genetic resources poses a complex global issue, requiring a balance between promoting innovation and safeguarding biological diversity and traditional knowledge. China's proactive incorporation of clauses in its patent law to align with the CBD principles showcases its commitment to protecting genetic resources while ensuring equitable sharing of benefits. Conversely, the U.S., while not a party to the CBD, prioritizes unrestricted access to genetic resources, presenting its own challenges in international cooperation.
China's approach to human stem cell patentability, shaped by Confucian cultural values, prioritizes human dignity and genetic integrity, leading to strict regulations protecting human embryos. In contrast, the U.S. focuses on excluding judicially created exceptions, resulting in the granting of patents for human embryonic stem cells. Both approaches encounter unique challenges, with China's cultural emphasis potentially limiting scientific research and advancements, while the U.S. approach raises concerns about broad patents hindering future innovations.
As cultures and customs evolve with economic development, it becomes essential for China to continually assess and adapt its patent laws, striking a balance between cultural values, societal needs, and technological progress. This will ensure that China's approach to biological subject matter eligibility remains responsive to the changing demands of society, promoting an environment where innovation and progress can flourish in harmony with its cultures and customs.
A promising avenue to achieve this balance is by harmonizing eligibility of biological subject matters through compulsory licensing when voluntary licensing is not feasible or falls short. This avenue holds the potential to preserve community cultural values, encourage knowledge sharing, and ensure the affordability and widespread availability of essential technologies while fostering innovation. Additionally, it can help streamline international trade, encourage cross-border trade and investment, and promote economic integration and cooperation.",,,"As evidenced by the comparison between China and the U.S., each country has implemented patent laws tailored to its specific context, values, and goals, while also complying with its international treaties.

However, this principle developed into different strands as nation-state building disintegrated the statefamily continuum and as legal reforms de-Confucianized the legal system. As indicated in the local legal archives in Jiangjin, the transformation of filial piety crystallized in at least three aspects: legal punishment for unfilial behavior, property distribution with respect to who had the privileges or the power to determine inheritance, and the interpretations of what counted as filial. Over time, punishment for unfilial children gradually decreased in severity. Children obtained more say in property distribution. Love, deference, and financial responsibility within ones family were decoupled from state legitimacy.

The socially accepted concept of filiality also diverged from the legally acknowledged concept of filiality. Informed by new sources of knowledge during the Republican era, the universalist principle of filial piety grew into at least four new interpretations of social and legal relations. The ramifications and recreation of the integrated principle of filial piety were realized in legal practice through negotiations and struggles among those involved. The meaning of filial piety in use depended on the available knowledge during the immediate situation, as structured by legal reforms, nation-state building, and local particularities. Ultimately, the outcome was not one form of filial piety but multiple diverse, sometimes even contradictory, interpretations of filial piety.

The four strands of filial piety provided resources for various actors, including lawyers, legal professionals, litigants, and plaintiffs, to use in actual legal practice. These interpretations interacted in legal practice through competition, negotiation, and compromise. Through such interactions, interpretations of filial piety empowered certain groups while marginalizing others. For example, in practice, local legal interpretations of parent?Cchild relations were often gendered. Although codes and other legal designs canceled the parental authority of mothers, local legal practices continued to reinforce the powerful position of fathers. Women, especially mothers, were marginalized in this transitional moment, revealing the uneven influence and local implementation of legal reforms imposed on various social groups. Nonetheless, despite the patrilineal nature of property relations?? continuity, the transformation during the Qing?CRepublic transition indicates that the previously integrated notion of filial piety had gradually faded.

Final",,,"It argues that two overlapping processes??legal reforms and nation-state building??synergized to restructure the meaning of filial piety from a largely integrated principle in Qing, which bridged the gaps between filiality and loyalty to the emperor and between personalized morality and imperial state legitimacy, to divergent new interpretations of filial piety, including the individualist filial piety, nationalist filial piety, legal filial piety, and sentimental filial piety. Each new interpretation inherits only part of its original meaning and incorporates newly introduced legal knowledge of legal equality and property ownership. The article concludes that various, sometimes contradictory interpretations of filial piety indicate the Republican legal reforms as an in-between, dynamic spectrum of legal change with vigorous negotiations among different legal actors and knowledge regimes.","Research question implicitly stated.

DOES BANKRUPTCY LAW PREVENT INTERNALIZATION OF ENVIRONMENTAL COSTS: EVIDENCE FROM CHINA,Xingwei Li,"Xingwei Li, Does Bankruptcy Law Prevent Internalization of Environmental Costs: Evidence from China, 23 Journal of International Business and Law, 159-193 (2024)",Journal of International Business and Law,https://www.hofstrajibl.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Li%E2%80%94Vol.23.2-Stage-1.pdf,,"\introduction - In 2019, the Intermediate People's Court of Qiqihar City, Heilongjiang Province, China declared Heihua Co., Ltd (Heihua) bankrupt.1 Despite the fact that Heihua had made great contributions to economic development within the Heilongjiang province, it was also at fault for discharging vast amounts of smoke, dust, and heavy metals into the surrounding land and air which caused subsequent environmental damage, in terms of land and air pollution, as well as water contamination.2 Bankruptcy was attributable to these environmental issues, as well as the firm's aging equipment, yet the aforementioned environmental issues were not resolved following the completion of the bankruptcy process; with the soil and groundwater at the former Heihua site containing a large quantity of heavy metals far in excess of national standards, the site was later identified as heavily contaminated.3 Cleanup and restoration of the contaminated site is in the public's best interest.4 As the liquidation process of the bankrupt company has since concluded, it follows that any future rectification of consequential environmental damage stemming from the Heihua site must be covered by public funds.5
This highlights a common issue: the polluting company will be rendered bankrupt with several of its environmental issues still outstanding and pass any such liability on to the public--in other words, the cost of environmental liability will be borne by public funds.6
Based on the current environmental legal framework in China, both the Tort chapter of the Civil Code 2020 and the Environmental Protection Law 2014 apply the ??polluter pays?? principle, which requires polluters to assume responsibility for the cost of environmental *160 cleanup and/or its remediation and restoration.7 However, the polluter pays principle is being challenged by Chinese Enterprises Bankruptcy Law (??EBL??).8
In the context of EBL, environmental liability is classified as a general, unsecured liability in the order of distribution during the winding up process.9 In most cases generalized, unsecured claims face difficulty in being paid out of the funds from the winding up process, which results in the externalization or ??transfer?? of environmental costs from the bankrupt polluter to the public.10 These costs are known to economists as negative externalities.11
If such environmental costs ","The polluter pays principle is explicitly detailed within Chinese environmental legislation, but this principle has been challenged in the context of bankruptcy law. 442 In practice, environmental costs have been transferred to society in bankruptcy proceedings, with many contaminated sites not having been cleaned up post-liquidation. 443 Some companies use bankruptcy regimes to escape their environmental responsibilities. 444 The enactment of EBL 2006 was a success in that it solved the problem of bankruptcy in China. 445 However, EBL 2006 has now become a haven for polluters insofar as environmental resources have become a somewhat free cost for companies under the bankruptcy framework in China. 446 From the perspective of the polluter pays principle, EBL 2006 has thus revealed a number of problems, such as a lack of environmental representation in bankruptcy proceedings, as well as environmental liabilities not being given priority in the winding up process. EBL 2006 should consider several changes to realize the internalization of environmental costs, such as giving priority to environmental liability in winding up and increasing the presence of environmental representatives in bankruptcy proceedings, which are recommendations on bankruptcy proceedings. 447 Meanwhile, the corporate entity post-liquidation is also an important way to internalize environmental costs. Therefore, the corporate veil should be lifted when there is sufficient evidence that a company??s shareholders have deliberately transferred property to avoid environmental liability, or that corporate accounts have been mixed with private accounts.",,How Chinese law treats environmental liabilities in bankruptcy proceedings.,"Environmental claims are not provided for in this bankruptcy law.  This increases the difficulty for environmental liabilities claims in bankruptcy cases.  Furthermore, the EBL 2006 provides for a new order of distribution and confirms that priority claims are in Articles 43 and 113. However, environmental liability is not mentioned in the priority claims, which means it should be classified as general claims.  Therefore, the environmental liability of bankrupt polluters has become an issue because the provisions on environmental liabilities in the EBL 2006 are blank.  It results in the environmental liability of bankrupt polluters being ignored and transferred to public funds.",,Doctrinal Legal Research,,N.

Elite Capture: How Decentralization and Informal Institutions Weaken Property Rights in China,Daniel Mattingly,"Daniel Mattingly, Elite Capture: How Decentralization and Informal Institutions Weaken Property Rights in China, 68(3) World Politics, 383-412 (2016).",World Politics,https://muse.jhu.edu/pub/122/article/621687,,"Political decentralization is often argued to strengthen political accountability by bringing government closer to the people. Social and civic institutions at the local level, such as lineage associations, temples, churches, or social clubs, can make it easier for citizens to monitor officials and hold them accountable. This article argues that strong social institutions also empower local elites who may use their informal influence to control their group and capture rents. Drawing on evidence from case studies of Chinese villages, the article shows that lineage group leaders who become village officials use their combination of social and political authority to confiscate villagers?? land. Evidence from a survey experiment suggests that endorsement of a land confiscation plan by lineage elites elicits gr","the lesson of this article is simple: local civil society groups often serve as tools of political control, and cannot replace formal institutions of accountability. as work by ostrom and tsai shows, nonstate groups can to a certain extent help members police themselves, especially in the context of repeated interaction. 58 When these groups are truly autonomous, they can even help curb state predation. For example, similar to the findings presented here, timothy Frye finds that business organizations in russia can help protect private property. 59 But the incorporation of the leaders of these groups into state institutions does not represent real political inclusion, rather, it is a form of co-optation.

these findings show how seemingly democratic institutions can serve as institutions of co-optation even at the lowest level of politics. the literature to date has shown how regimes co-opt elites in national legislatures 60 and how authoritarian institutions help the regime distribute rents and resolve conflict between political factions. 61 Scholars of Chinese politics have also investigated how the regime has experimented with feedback mechanisms, transparency, and limited press freedoms to gather information about the behavior of local officials. 62 Yet the logic of political co-optation in local politics is comparatively unexplored.

Future work might examine whether co-opting local elites is an effective long-term strategy. it may not be, since once local elites have used their power to capture rents from land development, they lose their moral authority. in the short term, this may not matter to local officials as long as they can extract enough from each village to fill local coffers (as well as their own pockets). Yet there are only so many villages in which this governance strategy can be repeated, and so it may trade short-term gains for long-term problemsas has arguably occurred with social service policies or efforts to strengthen rule of law without an independent judiciary or civil society.63 

these findings stand in stark contrast to a number of recent studies that have linked strong informal institutions in rural China to high levels of public goods provision. 64 these findings also raise the question of whether there is a trade-off between public goods and property rightsa bargain in which villagers receive more public goods but have weaker land rights might benefit local elites. Future work on distributive politics in rural China should examine public goods alongside local development policies.

outside of China, there are intriguing parallels between the role of lineage leaders and other types of local political brokers. the most obvious may be with traditional leaders such as tribal chiefs. Daron acemog?lu, tristan reed, and James robinson find that chiefs in Sierra leone exploit their control over local civil society to control local politics and development. 65 Kate Baldwin shows how national leaders cede control over land to traditional chiefs to increase electoral support among noncoethnics. 66 interestingly, Baldwin also finds that voters tend to cast their ballots for political candidates endorsed by chiefs because they infer, correctly, that politicians with connections to chiefs will provide higher levels of public goods. 67 this is broadly consistent with the idea that traditional kinship institutions can help buttress public goods provision, which occurs in a context of repeated interaction and relatively low stakes, but leaves open the question of what role these elite might play in large-scale land requisitions. recent work by lauren Honig finds that it is autonomous chiefs with power that historically has been independent of the state that protect their constituents from land confiscation.68 

a second parallel is with other types of brokers in the developing world. there is intriguing evidence that outside of China, local brokers also trade targeted benefits in return for support for elites, who often gain much more in the bargain. 69 For example, tariq thachil shows how elite parties in india use nonstate groups to supply services to the poor and in return, the poor vote for parties whose policies disproportionately benefit the elite. 70 other types of brokers, such as the leaders of informal settlements, 71 could play similar roles in other contexts.

in general, elite capture of decentralized institutions is probably widespread. For example, Edmund Malesky, Cuong Viet nguyen, and anh tran show how in Vietnam local councils were captured by existing political elite, who diverted public resources for their own benefit.72  as a consequence, the abolition of local councils led to a surprising improvement in public service provision. My research also shows that elite capture is not inevitable. When village officials in China face competition from lineage elites who have not joined local political institutions, their behavior is constrained, and land requisitions are less likely. in this way, rival elites can pl",,"i examine whether including the leaders of lineage groups in village political institutions in China not only improves public goods provision, as the recent literature establishes, but also limits the power of local officials to appropriate villagers?? land.","I find that the inclusion of lineage leaders in village political institutions weakens villagers?? land rights... these findings show how strong social institutions can benefit citizens when it comes to public goods, yet hurt them when it comes to property protection??suggesting that social institutions serve as channels of bottom-up informal accountability and top-down political control.

This article examines the linkages between local governments' fiscal pressures and Chinese judges' decisions on financial sanctions. Based on data from criminal verdicts of official corruption and county government expenditures, this study finds that Chinese judges are more likely to impose financial penalties, especially fines, when judicial expenditures in a region are low. The conclusion remains unchanged after accounting for the endogeneity problem using the age of the county party secretary and the per capita financial expenditure lagged for one period as instrumental variables. Finally, the imprisonment penalty without increasing revenue is used to test the placebo, and no effect of fiscal pressure on the imprisonment penalty is found.","We organize data regarding the first trial of criminal cases on embezzlement and bribery crimes published by courts, matching them with the per capita financial expenditures of counties in China. Then, we empirically test the influence of fiscal pressure on judges?? financial penalty decisions. It is found that China??s courts exhibit great differences in their economic punishment of corrupt officials, which is related to the financial incentives caused by local fiscal pressure. When court funds in a region are lower, the judges there have stronger incentives to issue financial penalties to maximi""court revenue, part of which comes from commissions from the local government according to the value of financial penalties judged and executed by each court. This phenomenon is more obvious for fines, which have a stronger ability to increase revenue for the court.

This phenomenon of fiscal incentives caused by fiscal pressure is more prominent in regulatory agencies, including the police force, procuratorates and courts, which have a strong ability to increase revenue. Incomes from fines and confiscations have become an important source of increased local revenue, are included in budget management and decomposed to criminal justice personnel at various levels, and are even used as an indicator in evaluations. The Ministry of Finance issued the ""Measures for the Administration of Fines and Confiscated Property"" to the Supreme People??s Court, the Supreme People??s Procuratorate, the Supervisory Commission, and the Department (Bureau) of Finance in various provinces and cities as well as other relevant departments on December 17th, 2020, emphasizing once again: ""e budget of fines and confiscations in the government budget revenue is a predictive index and is not issued as a revenue task index. The funds for criminal justice agencies to handle cases are guaranteed to be provided by the budget of the government at the corresponding level, and the budget arrangements for law enforcement agencies should not be linked to the fines and confiscation cases they handle in any year."" This indicates that there is indeed a clear phenomenon in which the value of fines and confiscated property is taken as an evaluation index in judicial practice. Economic incentives and competition forge a close link between the behavior of judicial personnel and economic interests, leading them to selectively enforce the law, expand the scope of punishment for some crimes, and even identify one crime as another crime to increase the benefits derived from fines and confiscated property. This common judicial injustice is driven by the desire to obtain more income from financial penalties (Smercina et al., 2022). If the behavior of judicial personnel is not only linked to criminal activities but also affected by local finances and economic interests, then the justice offered by the courts will be in doubt, harming judicial credibility and therefore causing serious damage to social justice. Therefore, the legal system should be improved, the reform of the financial system should be accelerated, and the judicial reform process should be promoted. The joint results of these changes can achieve the goal of judicial fairness and justice.

Three policy implications should be considered. First, full funding for the judicial branch should be ensured, and the reform of unified financial management of the judiciary should be further accelerated. In particular, the government should speed up the financial reform in the regions where financial management is jointly administered by the provincial and local governments and the traditional management of local government is maintained.

Using civil society network analysis, this article aims to identify and account for interactions between the EPIL Network and other stakeholders, including the government. Finally, the study highlights the contributions of the EPIL Network, which provides an option for resolving political conflicts in China regarding municipal waste management.","The EPIL has become an influential tool in municipal waste politics. In the beginning, the EPIL Network aimed to serve as an independent third party between ENGOs and local governments to engage them in dialogue and cooperation and to try to provide them with neutral information. The new environmental protection law and the judicial interpretations that further clarified the standing of environmental groups in filing EPILs in the courts in 2015 were the legal basis and background of the EPIL support network. In recent years, with professionalized reform and advancement, the EPIL Networks role in leading environmental litigation has grown; it influences government policies and collaborates with courts and government actors to leverage social impact. Working with legal professionals and local courts, the EPIL Network has built extensive capacity in environmental public interest litigation as well as in cases of waste problems. Wells-Dang points out that it is difficult for civil society organization networks in China to build networks with government agencies. 47 In this study, however, the EPIL has made not only horizontal networks among participants but also vertical networks between citizens and government officials. The members of the EPIL Network mutually reinforce their missions and efforts, leading to improved outcomes in managing municipal waste. 48 Working with different stakeholders, the EPIL Network has more expertise in MSW management systems and policies to identify sources of litigation cases that have strategic implications for the MSW system. Additionally, the EPIL Network supports its members in effectively developing litigation strategies to achieve their goals and their dynamics help improve the EPIL system. Nevertheless, the EPIL Network attempts to establish relationships through the courts with the government to provide resolutions on waste management. The collaboration between the EPIL Network and local governments reveals that local governments consult with NGOs and tend to have more policy influence.49 

To conclude, the study illustrates the role of the EPIL Network in the politics of municipal waste management in China.

For example, the number of annual flood disasters worldwide rose from 1,389 to 3,254 between 2000 and 2019, accounting for 40% of the total number of *363 disasters and affecting 1.65 million people.7 The number of annual storm disasters rose from 1,457 to 2,034 in that time, accounting for 28% of the total number of disasters.8 In addition, the number of droughts, wildfires, extreme temperatures, and other natural disasters, such as earthquakes and tsunamis, have increased significantly.9
China experiences some of the most frequent and serious natural disasters in the world.10 These natural disasters are diverse, widespread, frequent, and damaging11 and have hindered China's sustainable development and ecological civilization construction.12 In some ecologically fragile and economically impoverished areas, a negative feedback cycle occurs in which economic and social considerations influence development.13 This in turn influences the level of ecological impact from frequent natural disasters.14 Furthermore, ecologically fragile, vegetated areas in ecological transition overlap with areas in the composite interlaced zones of agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry, which suffer from ecological problems as a result of short-sighted management.15 According to the 2008 National Plan for the Protection of Ecologically Fragile Areas, economic losses in these areas due to various natural disasters, such as floods, sandstorms, mudslides, and landslides, cost about 200 billion yuan16 per year, *364 and the natural disaster loss rate increases by an average of 9% per year, which is higher than the average GDP growth rate of ecologically fragile areas.17 Additionally, between 1989 and 2019, the average annual disaster area of China's crops reached 40.2 million hectares, the average annual death toll was 870 (excluding 2008),18 and more than 80% of disaster-related casualties and economic losses occurred in rural areas.19 Extreme climate events frequently result in meteorological disasters because more than 70% of the 830 poverty-stricken counties in the country are in areas vulnerable to flooding and related disasters.20
In recent decades, ecosystem degradation induced many of the mega-natural disasters21 that occurred in China.22 In addition to natural conditions, human actions that cause deterioration of the ecological environment are important factors in mega-natural disasters.23 These actions include significant farmland reclamation around lakes, which greatly shrinks the area of lakes and wetlands, causes severe damage to forest cover within the *365 watershed, and thereby contributes to increased soil erosion.24 In 2010, for example, a devastating landslide occurred in Zhouqu County of the Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture within the Gansu Province, killing 1,557 people, leaving 208 missing, flooding two-thirds of Zhouqu County, and affecting 50,000 people in total.25 Besides the natural causes of the disaster--geology, landscape, extreme rainstorms, and drought--human activities in Zhouqu, like poor urban planning, serious deforestation and land reclamation, and excessive development and construction of water conservancy resources, have aggravated disasters and their consequences.26 Human action has also contributed to the frequent urban floods in recent years.27 One of the leading causes is the rapid expansion of cities, which has diminished the ecological regulatory function of natural features, weakening urban stormwater management.28
It is essential to strengthen the sustainable use of natural resources and integrated ecosystem management for disaster risk reduction. In response to this need, the ecosystem-based approach to disaster risk reduction (EbADRR) has emerged.29 This approach is based on management principles, strategies, and tools that maximize the use of ecosystem services to reduce disaster risk and achieve sustainable and resilient development goals.30 In 2008, the World Bank proposed the exploration of nature-based solutions (NbS) as a strategy for mitigating and adapting to climate change.31 Since then, the concept of NbS has become an umbrella for ecosystem-related approaches, which are defined as ??actions to protect, sustainably manage and restore natural or modified ecosystems, which address societal challenges ... effectively and adaptively, while simultaneously providing human well-being and biodiversity benefits.??32
*366 Environmental law can be a powerful tool to ensure the implementation of NbS strategies in the context of disasters by focusing on ecosystem protection.33 Coincident with the drafting of an ecological code in China, this paper aims to seize this opportunity to transform the legal application of NbS to disasters from discrete to systematic. This Article is structured in four parts. Part I provides an overview of the global natural disaster landscape, with a specific focus on China, including notable incidents like the 1998 Yangtze River floods, the 2010 Gansu Z","Constructing an ecological civilization in China requires innovation within the legal system and, consequently, the improvement of existing legal mechanisms and the creation of new ones.

From Internet to social safety net: The policy consequences of online participation in China,"Junyan Jiang, Tianguang Meng, Qing Zhang","Junyan Jiang, Tianguang Meng, Qing Zhang, From internet to social safety net: the policy consequences of online participation in China, 32(3) Governance, 531-547 (2019). ",Governance,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/gove.12391,https://doi.org/10.1111/gove.12391,"Internet-based platforms are increasingly being used by governments around the world to facilitate public engagement with citizens. However, it remains an open question whether participation through these platforms can actually enable citizens to influence policies. We address this question by studying the patterns and consequences of online participation at a major electronic petition platform in China, a country with the world's largest Internet-using population. Content analysis of over 900,000 petitions reveals that a substantial share of them concern lower-class issues and are originated from less developed rural and suburban areas. Linking variations in petition volumes to an original data set of government policy priorities, we further show that online participation led governments to place greater emphasis on social welfare policies and to increase the coverage of a key low-income assistance program. These results underscore the potential of online participation as an important mechanism to improve the quality of governance.","As one of the most influential technological inventions of the 20th century, the Internet is seen by many as having the potential to give citizens a louder voice in the political process. However, concrete evidence on whether and how Internet-based participation can affect government policies remains limited to date. This article addresses this gap by presenting new evidence on the policy consequences of online participation from China's largest electronic petition platform. Contrary to the prevailing view that in developing countries the Internet is still a luxury technology enjoyed mainly by middle- and upper-class elites (Norris, 2001), our results suggest that when broadband infrastructure is made nearly universal, those from lower-class backgrounds will actively take advantage of new online channels to articulate their interests, and that their participation can lead local governments to place higher priority on social welfare issues in both rhetoric and actual policy implementation.

Our article speaks to the literature on the relation between the Internet and governance. Existing research has found that the Internet can help strengthen government accountability (Besley & Burgess, 2002) and reduce corruption (Bailard, 2009), but may also suppress voter turnout (Campante, Durante, & Sobbrio, 2013) and increase ideological polarization (Lelkes, Sood, & Iyengar, 2017). On the issue of political inequality, more specifically, empirical findings from survey-based studies in advanced democracies (the United States in particular) tend to support the view that the Internet will reinforce, rather than alleviate, the participation and influence gaps in the offline world (Norris, 2001; Schlozman, Verba, & Brady, 2010). Our findings suggest that the conclusion drawn from the experience of developed countries may not necessarily apply to a developing context where the opportunities for conventional forms of participation are more biased and limited. We provide evidence that supports the Internet's potential to mitigate participation inequality among citizens and show that bringing in new voices into politics can substantively change governments' policy priorities. While we certainly need to be cautious to not overgeneralize findings from one platform, it is worth noting that some of the key features that made the platform effective, including operational independence, ease of access, and transparency, are not rare qualities in the cyberspace. As many other countries and regions have started to adopt similar electronic petition platforms, a promising direction of future research will be to investigate whether a similar equalizing impact also exists in other country settings.

This article also contributes to a nascent but rapidly growing literature on nonelectoral responsiveness. Several recent studies have shown that in some non-Western political systems, and China in particular, inquiries and demands made by individual citizens receive replies from governments at a comparable rate as in electoral democracies (Chen et al., 2016; Distelhorst & Hou, 2017), and that individual politicians are generally attentive to citizen opinions (Meng, Pan, & Yang, 2014; Truex, 2016). So far, however, there is still limited evidence on whether, in the absence of formal electoral accountability, the preferences and demands expressed by citizens will be systematically taken into account in government policymaking??a more fundamental criterion of political responsiveness according to the original formulation of this concept (Dahl, 1998; Miller & Stokes, 1963). Our findings suggest the existence of a form of responsiveness in China that matches with its canonical definition in the democratic context.

Finally, our analysis advances a more nuanced view on the relation between the Internet and the durability of the",,Whether participation through internet-based platforms can actually enable citizens to influence policies.,"Our analysis shows that a substantial share of the LLMB petitions concern personal problems that are most likely to be experienced by lower-class citizens, including employment, neighborhood environment, and land-taking compensation. We also find that a sizable share of the petitions are originated from rural and suburban areas, which are inhabited primarily by individuals who belong to the lower strata of the Chinese society..... show that cities that receive a larger number of online petitions in a year tend to devote significantly higher proportions of government reports in the following year to a topic on social welfare, which broadly includes issues such as low-income subsidies, unemployment protection, and medical assistance. We also find that the policy effect appears to be mainly driven by petitions filed by rural residents concerning issues related to their pocketbook conditions",,Empirical (Quant),Text analysis,N.

FROM WITHIN: THE INFLUENCE OF DOMESTIC NON-STATE ACTORS ON CHINA'S INTERNATIONAL LEGAL POLICIES,"Chaoyi Jiang, Li Chen","Chaoyi Jiang, Li Chen, From Within: The Influence of Domestic Non-State Actors on China's International Legal Policies, 44 Northwestern Journal of International Law and Business, 413-470 (2024)",Northwestern Journal of International Law and Business,https://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/njilb/vol44/iss3/2/,https://doi.org/10.1111/gove.12391,"Beijing's growing global influence has led to increased Chinese participation in various international initiatives, many of which intersect with international law, from trade to climate change. This has prompted scholars to focus more on China's engagement with international law, aiming to develop effective strategies for interacting with this emerging global power.
Any analysis of international law's role in a domestic system must consider the relevant actors, their influences, the issues they address, and the prevailing legal regime. This article offers new insights into Chinese policy formation by examining how influential domestic groups impact decision-making on specific public international law issues, their policy preferences, and their level of influence. It focuses primarily on non-state actors operating independently from the formal establishment, including State-owned enterprises (SOEs), private sector firms, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), netizens, and media.
This article further examines the roles of these domestic actors within the internal policy-making process regarding matters of international law and how international law, in response, either constrains or empowers these actors.
Finally, this article evaluates how increased participation of non-state actors might impact government accountability. This evaluation considers the broader context of rivalries among ministries and committees within the State Council, the evolving distribution of responsibilities, power dynamics between central and local governments, and the ongoing legal capacity-building efforts of relevant agencies.","To conclude, state actors striving for economic growth partner with
SOEs and influential private sector players, who are primarily motivated by
profit, in the formulation and implementation of public policies. When
viewed as crucial tools for socio-economic progress, there is a common
ground between such enterprises and public stakeholders at different levels. This alliance would be a durable and powerful influence over the formulation
of mainly inward-looking policies, which are less likely to be trumped by
broader considerations of non-economic national interests.
NGOs can establish bridging connections through official sponsorship,
supervision, or informal endorsements. An illustration of this is the
significant role played by academia from government-affiliated universities
in advocating for policy changes within the party-states control. This can
include participating in legislative and political consultation processes at the
central and local levels, as well as engaging in individual litigation that aims
for specific and partial modifications, rather than systematic ones.
Finally, with increasing limitations placed on NGOs, the Internet has
emerged as an effective means of grassroots policy-shaping, providing an
alternative avenue for advocacy and mobilization. Even for less sensitive
environmental NGOs, such as those that have successfully utilized online
campaigns as part of their advocacy for policy changes, many of them have
primarily shifted the focus of their activities to implementation. Such NGOs
now engage mainly in monitoring and public interest litigation, public
education, and advocacy for environment-friendly policies and legislation,
rather than mobilization, so that they would obtain and maintain a formal
legal status after the revised Environmental Protection Law entered into force
on January 1, 2015.295
The capacity of public opinion to influence foreign policy changes in
China hinges on the impact of the relevant issue on the Governments
domestic standing. Social issues that gain widespread attention, especially in
the digital age, require the Government to respond to external disclosure and
questioning since its oversight of information channels has evolved. The
2015 documentary on air pollution and the Diaoyu Islands incident are
examples of public opinion playing a role in shaping policy. Chinese
nationalists who believed there was a mismatch between the party-states
historical narrative for legitimizing its rule and the pragmatic policies it
implemented in the present to pursue state interests triggered the protests
during the Diaoyu Islands incident. Public attention made it difficult for the
central government to deviate from the path of behavior dictated by the
radical nationalists who dominate public opinion by soberly handling
territorial disputes or smoothly advancing trade negotiations.
The 2015 documentary on air pollution gained significant public
interest. It sparked intense debates throughout China due to the widespread
recognition and awareness of severe smog and haze, which have negatively
impacted the health of every individual living in polluted regions. In this
regard, the central government had resolved to confront air pollution, but it
aimed to conceal these shortcomings in governance from public scrutiny to safeguard its reputation for good governance and potentially expedite
internal reforms.
The common feature of these occurrences was the swift and unforeseen
emergence of public opinions that spread beyond the party-state??s control
with the assistance of the Internet. Although the government limited public
access to the 2015 documentary within two weeks of its release, with official
directives prohibiting Chinese news media from further reporting on it,296
Internet-based communication enabled the rapid dissemination of the
information conveyed by the documentary to a broader audience. This led to
increased public awareness and the formation of dominant public opinion
within a short time.
Nonetheless, the impact of online public opinion on instigating change
is limited unless it effectively connects a foreign affairs issue to domestic
concerns, resonating with the Chinese public and prompting the country??s
political leaders to tak",,"how Chinese policy is shaped by analyzing the impact of influential domestic groups on the decisionmaking process regarding specific issues of public international law, their policy preferences, and their levels of influence.

Second, informally acquired labor law knowledge can substitute for formal education in bringing people to the legal system and improving their legal experiences. The Chinese state's propagation of legal knowledge has had positive effects on citizens' legal mobilization. Finally, while education and legal knowledge are factors that push people toward the legal system, actual dispute experience leads people away from it, especially among disputants without effective legal representation.

Since that time the government has invested a significant amount of time and resources in teaching the population about law at schools, at the workplace, and in the media (Exner 1995). In the case narratives above, disputants make use of these resources to become informed consumers of legal institutions. In some cases, they make up for a lack in formal education to become seasoned experts, helping friends and colleagues with similar problems. Gaining knowledge and experience is part of the legal mobilization process. Although political participation in authoritarian regimes is, by definition, more narrowly circumscribed and restricted, in this case the state has instrumentally expanded the space for individualized mobilization, delegating the task of law enforcement to workers themselves. However, the effects of this engagement are contradictory. The citizenry is more active, engaged, and discriminating, but many who take the state's exhortations to use the law seriously end up disaffected with legal institutions, especially when they lack effective representation.

L. 207 (2024).",Tulane Journal of International and Comparative Law,https://journals.tulane.edu/jicl/article/view/3917/3671,,"When Yang Shuping, an exchange student from China, delivered a commencement address at the University of Maryland in May of 2017,1 she prompted criticism from her home state's government.2 At the commencement, Yang spoke about the fresh air of free speech and expression she experienced in the United States, articulating that [d]emocracy and free speech should not be taken for granted ... [they] are worth fighting for.3 While presumably uncontroversial to the Western listener, American news outlets were quick to note that the response from the People's Republic of China (P.R.C.) was stern.4 According to U.S. media, [s]tate run-newspapers [in China] fanned the flames of controversy when those papers quoted sources criticizing Yang's speech as immature and mean.5 Following China's response to Yang, the American media establishment weighed in, characterizing the Chinese reaction as hateful and in contradiction to free speech norms.6
*209 But it is often too easy for Western society to paint a foreign legal culture with one broad stroke of the brush. For instance, in September of the same year [t]he heads of ten [Chinese] universities issued a joint statement that condemned recent abuses of freedom of expression on college campuses.7 To be sure, university officials and students alike indicated that state regulation of speech undoubtedly violate the right of students and teachers to freely discuss politics inside campus.8 And, according to the P.R.C.'s Ministry of Education, students have the right to be aware of the major issues concerning the reform and development of schools, [to] provide [] opinions and suggestions on school affairs, and participate[] in democratic supervision.9
While Western media outlets characterized the Chinese response to Yang as nationalistic and in contravention of free speech norms, this was an overly simplistic view of the issue.10 In fact, it is clear that many in the Chinese establishment believe that free expression is a fundamental right on college campuses.11 However, like all rights in China, expression and speech are limited by traditional Confucian values.12 For instance, a central tenant of Confucian philosophy is to avoid disrupting Li13 meaning that members of a Confucian society should strive to conform their behavior to protect the order of society and safeguard superior-inferior relationship dynamics.14 Hence, while the American media interpreted China's response to Yang as being part of an anti-free speech culture,15 the reality is much more complex.16 In fact, the Chinese response was likely not rooted in anti-free speech sentiment at all but rather in the Confucian understanding that Yang had not acted in accordance with Li when she insulted China and disturbed the national order.17 Hence, what *210 appeared to be an invidious reaction to some in the West was merely the embodiment of fundamental Confucian values by Chinese commentators.18

How Censorship in China Allows Government Criticism but Silences Collective Expression,"Gary King, Jennifer Pan, Margaret E Roberts","Gary King, Jennifer Pan & Margaret E. Roberts, How Censorship in China Allows Government Criticism but Silences Collective Expression, 107 Am. Pol. Sci. Rev. 326 (2013).",American Political Science Review,https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review/article/how-censorship-in-china-allows-government-criticism-but-silences-collective-expression/C7EF4A9C9D59425C2D09D83742C1FE00,https://doi.org/10.1017/S0003055413000014,"We offer the first large scale, multiple source analysis of the outcome of what may be the most extensive effort to selectively censor human expression ever implemented. To do this, we have devised a system to locate, download, and analyze the content of millions of social media posts originating from nearly 1,400 different social media services all over China before the Chinese government is able to find, evaluate, and censor (i.e., remove from the Internet) the subset they deem objectionable. Using modern computer-assisted text analytic methods that we adapt to and validate in the Chinese language, we compare the substantive content of posts censored to those not censored over time in each of 85 topic areas. Contrary to previous understandings, posts with negative, even vitriolic, criticism of the state, its leaders, and its policies are not more likely to be censored. Instead, we show that the censorship program is aimed at curtailing collective action by silencing comments that represent, reinforce, or spur social mobilization, regardless of content. Censorship is oriented toward attempting to forestall collective activities that are occurring now or may occur in the future??and, as such, seem to clearly expose government intent.","The new data and methods we offer seem to reveal highly detailed information about the interests of the Chinese people, the Chinese censorship program, and the Chinese government over time and within different issue areas. These results also shed light on an enormously secretive government program designed to suppress information, as well as on the interests, intentions, and goals of the Chinese leadership.

The evidence suggests that when the leadership allowed social media to flourish in the country, they also allowed the full range of expression of negative and positive comments about the state, its policies, and its leaders. As a result, government policies sometimes look as bad, and leaders can be as embarrassed, as is often the case with elected politicians in democratic countries, but, as they seem to recognize, looking bad does not threaten their hold on power so long as they manage to eliminate discussions associated with events that have collective action potentialwhere a locus of power and control, other than the government, influences the behaviors of masses of Chinese people. With respect to this type of speech, the Chinese people are individually free but collectively in chains.

Much research could be conducted on the implications of this governmental strategy; as a spur to this research, we offer some initial speculations here. For one, so long as collective action is prevented, social media can be an excellent way to obtain effective measures of the views of the populace about specific public policies and experiences with the many parts of Chinese government and the performance of public officials. As such, this loosening up on the constraints on public expression may, at the same time, be an effective governmental tool in learning how to satisfy, and ultimately mollify, the masses. From this perspective, the surprising empirical patterns we discover may well be a theoretically optimal strategy for a regime to use social media to maintain a hold on power. For example, Dimitrov (Reference Dimitrov2008) argues that regimes collapse when its people stop bringing grievances to the state, since it is an indicator that the state is no longer regarded as legitimate. Similarly, Egorov, Guriev, and Sonin (Reference Egorov, Guriev and Sonin2009) argue that dictators with low natural resource endowments allow freer media in order to improve bureaucratic performance. By extension, this suggests that allowing criticism, as we found the Chinese leadership does, may legitimize the state and help the regime maintain power. Indeed, Lorentzen (Reference Lorentzen2012) develops a formal model in which an authoritarian regimes balance media openness with regime censorship in order to minimize local corruption while maintaining regime stability. Perhaps the formal theory community will find ways of improving their theories after conditioning on our empirical results.

More generally, beyond the findings of this article, the data collected represent a new way to study China and different dimensions of Chinese politics, as well as facets of comparative politics more broadly. For the study of China, our approach sheds light on authoritarian resilience, center-local relations, subnational politics, international relations, and Chinese foreign policy. By examining what events are censored at the national level versus a subnational level, our approach indicates some areas where local governments can act autonomously. Additionally, by clearly revealing government intent, our approach allows an examination of the differences between the priorities of various subnational units of government. Because we can analyze social media and censorship in the content of real-world events, this approach is able to reveal insights into China's international relations and foreign policy. For example, do displays of nationalism constrain the government's foreign policy options and activities? Finally, China's censorship apparatus can be thought of as one of the input institutions. Nathan (Reference Nathan2003) identifies as an important source of authoritarian resilience, and the effectiveness and capabilities of the censorship apparatus may shed light on the CCP's regime institutionalization and longevity.

In the context of comparative politics, our work could directly reveal information about state capacity as well as shed light on the durability of authoritarian regimes and regime change. Recent work on the role of Internet and social media in the Arab spring (Ada et al. Reference Ada, Farrell, Lync, Sides and Freelon2012; Bellin Reference Bellin2012) debate the exact role played by these technologies in organizing collective action and motivating regional diffusion, but consistently highlight the relevance of these technological innovations on the longevity of authoritarian regimes worldwide. Edmond (Reference Edmond2012) models how the increase in information sources (e.g., Internet, social media) will be bad for a regime unless the regime has economies of scale in controlling information sources. While Internet and social media in general have smaller economies of scale, because of how China devolves the bulk of censorship responsibility to Internet content providers, the regime maintains large economies of scale in the face of new technologies. China, as a relatively rich and resilient authoritarian regime, with a sophisticated and effective censorship apparatus, is probably being watched closely by autocrats from around the world.

Beyond learning the broad aims of the Chinese censorship program, we seem to have unearthed a valuable source of continuous time information on the interests of the Chinese people and the intentions and goals of the Chinese government. Although we illustrated this with time series in 85 different topic areas, the effort could be expanded to many other areas chosen ex ante or even discovered as online communities form around new subjects over time. The censorship behavior we observe may be predictive of future actions outside the Internet (see Appendix C), is informative even when the traditional media is silent, and would likely serve a variety of other scholarly and practical uses in government policy and business relations.

Along the way, we also developed methods of computer-assisted text analysis that we demonstrate work well in the Chinese language and adapted it to this application. These methods would seem to be of use far beyond our specific application. We also conjecture that our data collection procedures, text analysis methods, engineering infrastructure, theories, and overall analytic and empirical strategies might be applicable in other parts of the world ",,what may be the most extensive effort to selectively censor human expression ever implemented,"The evidence suggests that when the leadership allowed social media to flourish in the country, they also allowed the full range of expression of negative and positive comments about the state, its policies, and its leaders.

Conventional wisdom holds that this strategy works because leaders can signal their benevolent intentions by removing corrupt officials. We argue that fighting against corruption can undermine regime support. By revealing scandals of corrupt officials, corruption investigations can alter citizens' beliefs about public officials and lead to disenchantment about political institutions. We test this argument by examining how China's current anti-corruption campaign has changed citizens' public support for the government and the Communist Party. We analyze the results of two original surveys conducted before and during the campaign, and employ a difference-in-differences strategy to show that corruption investigations, at the margin, suppress respondents' support for the central government and party. We also examine our respondents' prior and posterior beliefs, and the results support our updating mechanism.","Corruption is a global disease: it impedes economic growth, increases inequality, and erodes political legitimacy (Bardhan, Reference Bardhan1997; Seligson, Reference Seligson2002). Although some countries establish independent institutions, such as anti-corruption agencies or a judiciary, to control corruption, many resort to periodic campaigns to crack down on corruption.

Intensive corruption investigations, however, might undermine regime support. The leaders of the campaign can still benefit, for example by eliminating their enemies and consolidating their power, but the institutions they lead have to pay a public opinion cost. (Although observers frequently state that the anti-corruption campaign made Xi Jinping popular, there are no approval ratings for individual leaders in China, so we cannot determine what the public actually thinks of Xi.)

To our knowledge, this is the first quasi-experimental evidence of how corruption investigations affect regime support in an authoritarian regime. Using the case of China's current anti-corruption campaign, we show that citizens update their beliefs about public officials based on new information revealed during such campaigns. The more corruption the campaign reveals, the more it suppresses citizen support for the regime. Our findings reveal a bitter irony: corruption negatively impacts regime support, but fighting corruption is no panacea. In terms of public opinion, the cure may be as bad as the disease.

Because of the covert nature of corruption, citizens usually have imperfect knowledge about how corrupt their public officials are...The key insight is that the effect of anti-corruption depends on how the new information relates to citizens' prior beliefs.  Also there are four hypothesis, Hypothesis 1: Corruption investigations, on the margin, suppress citizens' support for the central government and Party, ceteris paribus. Hypothesis 2 (Updating Beliefs): Corruption investigations, on the margin, weaken citizens' beliefs about the integrity of public officials, ceteris paribus.

Does government-controlled media remain effective when it is required to support changes in positions that autocrats take on issues? Existing theories do not provide a clear answer to this question, but we often observe authoritarian governments using government media to frame policies in new ways when significant changes in policy positions are required. By conducting an experiment that exposes respondents to government-controlled media??in the form of TV news segments??on issues where the regime substantially changed its policy positions, we find that by framing the same issue differently, government-controlled media moves respondents to adopt policy positions closer to the ones espoused by the regime regardless of individual predisposition. This result holds for domestic and foreign policy issues, for direct and composite measures of attitudes, and persists up to 48 hours after exposure.","Through this experiment, we study whether authoritarian regimes can use government-controlled media to re-frame policy issue and change public opinion toward policies. From existing theory, we identify reasons why this may or may not be possible. Our experimental results suggest that when authoritarian regimes need to change their position on an issue, they can use government-controlled media to provide new frames for the issue and effectively shift public attitudes if they can achieve mainstream consensus, preventing alternative frames and contextual information from being voiced. Specifically, we find that government-controlled media, which frames domestic and foreign policy issues in different ways, moves respondents to adopt policy positions closer to the position, including opposing positions, espoused in government media. We find this to be the case whether we use direct or composite measures of attitudes, and we find that framing effects persist up to 48 hours after exposure.

Importantly, we find that different frames are effective regardless of individual predispositions. Both those who have pro-market and those who have pro-state preferences with regard to economic policy become more likely to support market-led reform of SOEs when they are exposed to a frame about the importance of efficiency, and both those who hold pro-market and those who hold pro-state economic preferences become more likely to support state-led reform of SOEs when they are exposed to a frame about the role of SOEs in serving public interests. Both those who are nationalist and those who are anti-nationalist become more likely to support dovish foreign policy when such policies are framed in terms of mutual prosperity, and respondents with differing predispositions toward nationalism all become more likely to support hawkish foreign policy when such policies are framed in terms of sovereignty and territorial integrity.

Finally, after controlling for predisposition, we find that those with higher levels of political knowledge are sometimes more influenced by framing effects than those with lower levels of political knowledge. This aligns with existing theories that knowledge increases the availability and comprehensibility of frames to individuals after accounting for predisposition.

While our results on predisposition diverge from the bulk of research on the role of predisposition as a moderator of government media and framing effects, these results align with previous theories that predict such a result when propagandists can dominate and control the media environment, suppressing competing frames and contextual information that could link predisposition to new messages from government media. Such a circumstance is extremely unlikely in any competitive media system, and hence unlikely in most democracies, but mainstream consensus is likely and indeed the reality in many authoritarian regimes where those in power effectively stifle alternative voices. Although not all authoritarian regimes can achieve such an outcome, there are numerous contemporaneous (e.g., China, Cuba, Iran, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Turkmenistan) and historical (Peru under Fujimori, U.S.S.R) examples of such regimes. This finding suggests that media market structure and context matter a great deal to understanding the boundaries of framing effects.","China,

In such a model, every object, such as an issue, event, or policy, has i attributes. An attitude consists of the sum of the product of an individual's evaluation of each attribute i and the salience weight of each attribute i...A large number of studies have sought to capture the processes underlying framing effects (Zaller, Reference Zaller1992; Iyengar, Reference Iyengar1994; Cappella and Jamieson, Reference Cappella and Jamieson1997; Price and Tewksbury, Reference Price, Tewksbury, Barnett and Boster1997; Nelson and Oxley, Reference Nelson and Oxley1999; Chong and Druckman, Reference Chong and Druckman2007). Typically, these studies find that conditional on exposure, an individual's attitude about an object may change if a given attribute of the object is (1) stored in a person's memory, (2) accessible, and (3) judged to be applicable or relevant when encountering new information.

The relationship between the government and the people is defined in this space, and thus the world has a great interest in what goes on there. We believe that considerably more resources and research should be devoted to this area. Whatever the appropriate relationship between governments and their people, a reasonable position is that it be open and known. This is an area where academic researchers can help. By devoting great effort, they can open up this knowledge to the world. It is our hope that others follow up on the research reported here.

More specifically, most journalists, activists, participants in social media, and some scholars have, until now, argued that the massive 50c party is devoted to engaging in argument that defends the regime, its leaders, and their policies. Our evidence indicates the opposite??that the 50c party engages in almost no argument of any kind and is instead devoted primarily to cheerleading for the state, symbols of the regime, or the revolutionary history of the Communist Party. We interpret these activities as the regime??s effort at st",,"In the first large-scale empirical analysis of this operation, we show how to identify the secretive authors of these posts, the posts written by them, and their content.","We estimate that the government fabricates and posts about 448 million social media comments a year. In contrast to prior claims, we show that the Chinese regime??s strategy is to avoid arguing with skeptics of the party and the government, and to not even discuss controversial issues. We show that the goal of this massive secretive operation is instead to distract the public and change the subject, as most of these posts involve cheerleading for China, the revolutionary history of the Communist Party, or other symbols of the regime.",,Enpirical -Mixed,Social media post analysis,N,N,N,"One way to parsimoniously summarize existing empirical results about information control in China is with a theory of the strategy of the regime. This theory, which as with all theories is a simplification of the complex realities on the ground, involves two complementary principles that the Chinese regime appears to follow, one passive and one active. The passive principle is do not engage on controversial issues: do not insert 50c posts supporting, and do not censor posts criticizing, the regime, its leaders, or their policies. The second, active, principle is stop discussions with collective action potential by active distraction and active censorship. Cheerleading in directed 50c bursts is one way the government distracts the public, although this activity can be also be used to distract from general negativity, government-related meetings and events with protest potential, and so forth...In contrast, our results suggest that the Chinese regime differentiates between two types of common knowledge??about specific grievances, which they allow, and about collective action potential, which they do a great deal to avoid. Avoiding the spread of common knowledge about collective action ","For the literature on authoritarian politics in general, our results may help refine current theories of the role of information, and particularly what is known as common knowledge, in theories of revolutionary mobilization. Many theories in comparative politics assume that autocrats slow the spread of information critical of the regime to minimize the development of common knowledge of grievances which in turn may reduce the probability of mobilization against the regime. The idea is that coordination is essential to revolution, and coordination requires some common knowledge of shared grievances (Chwe Reference Chwe2013; Egorov et al.

This information problem is caused by the milder, less visible repression that the SCS entails and is exacerbated by government information control in dictatorships. Using a field survey experiment, we show that respondents are not more supportive of the SCS when receiving information about its order-maintenance role but largely decrease their support when knowing its repressive function. Using observational data from the same field survey and a nationwide online survey, we find that citizens are more likely to support the SCS when their knowledge about it is from state media outlets. We further conduct text analysis of state media reports and show that the government portrays the SCS in a very positive way, with little mention of its repressive function. The evidence together highlights the role of information control in public support for the SCS in China.

The theory and findings have important implications for digital surveillance. They suggest that the government can hide the repressive potential of digital surveillance under its security-maintenance function to garner public support.

This study challenges that assumption by examining how improvements in the judiciary affect financial development in China. Using a quasi-natural experiment (i.e., staggered difference-in-difference estimation) over a twenty-year period, we find that the establishment of specialized financial adjudication","Based on our study's findings, several key conclusions emerge. First, provided that other conditions remain constant, the establishment of specialized financial adjudication institutions in China has been found to alleviate local financing constraints, thereby contributing to financial prosperity in these regions. Second, our analysis indicates that these positive effects are particularly significant for listed companies in central China, as well as for privately-owned and small to medium-sized enterprises within the listed company sector, underscoring the role of these institutions in promoting financial inclusion. Third, qualitative analysis suggests that specialized adjudication institutions in China contribute to investor confidence and market integrity through efficient and substantive protection of investors' rights. They also enhance the regulatory function of financial adjudication and improve the overall rule of law environment. These factors collectively optimize the financial transaction environment, reduce costs, and increase market participation, ultimately enhancing financial development in specific regions. In terms of policy implications, our study suggests that while not every region may be ready to establish financial courts or tribunals immediately, cultivating a cadre of specialized judges with expertise in financial adjudication could be a viable interim measure. These judges could form specialized teams to efficiently resolve financial disputes and contribute to financial sector stability. This experience is not only relevant to China but can also be applied to other emerging markets facing similar developmental challenges.
The findings of this study engender several expansive thinking. First, it is essential to adopt a developmental perspective on the relationship between legal origins and judicial characteristics, especially in the era of global legal system convergence (Pogrebennyk, 2014). Just as common law systems have incorporated aspects of statutory law, China's judicial adjudication within the civil law tradition has gradually acquired particular characteristics resembling those of common law systems (Liu et al., 2021). The establishment of specialized financial adjudication institutions in China serves as compelling evidence of this trend. Second, it is imperative to reassess the relationship between China's unique context and traditional Western theories. While researchers often emphasize China's exceptionalism, it is equally crucial to recognize the universality of China's developmental experiences compared to other countries and regions. Third, a nuanced understanding of the characteristics of China's judicial system is warranted. While conventional wisdom may view the influence of economic and political factors on China's judiciary as something negative, this study suggests that political embeddedness in the financial domain may have positive implications, such as mitigating financial risks and maintaining regional financial stability, thereby creating a conducive environment for financial transactions.
The limitations of this study need to be acknowledged. First, due to constraints in data availability, the dependent variable in this research is limited to the financing constraints of listed companies. This approach may not fully capture the financing difficulties faced by small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which are often more severe and prevalent. Interestingly, our heterogeneity analysis in Table 6 reveals that even among listed companies, the mitigating effect of financial courts and tribunals on financing constraints is significantly stronger for smaller firms. This suggests that our results may underestimate the true impact of financial courts and tribunals on alleviating financing constraints in the broader economy, particularly for SMEs. From a methodological standpoint, this potential underestimation strengthens our findings: If we observe significant effects using data that likely understates the true impact, it implies that the actual effect of financial courts and tribunals on financing constraints in the broader economy could be even more pronounced. Nevertheless, if feasible, future studies could broaden the scope by extending the research subjects from listed companies to non-listed companies, particularly SMEs. Additionally, it may be beneficial to incorporate more indicators to assess the level of financial development in specific regions more comprehensively. For example, changes in the number of financial enterprises in specific regions, as well as fluctuations in the number and business volume of commercial banks.
Second, concerning the mechanism explanation of empirical results, this paper primarily adopts a qualitative approach, including case studies and interviews.

J. Int'l L. 219 (2024)",Chicago Journal of International Law,https://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/cjil/vol25/iss1/5/,,"Around the world, governments are contemplating taking steps to reverse or mitigate the negative health and developmental effects that come from the increasing amount of time children are spending online and using screens. In 2023, the People's Republic of China (PRC) released a draft regulation restricting minors' screen time and internet use, which imposes a significant burden not only on children, but also on technology and internet companies that wish to continue operating in the country. However, the PRC's proposed minor mode regulation is neither an extreme departure from the types of restrictions neighboring countries in East Asia have imposed on children's screen time and internet use, nor its own previous regulations in this area. As such, the proposed regulation is unlikely to have violated a norm of customary international law against restricting children's internet use. Similarly, although international instruments like the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights guarantee a universal right of expression, which arguably includes an implied right to the internet, the proposed Chinese regulation is not likely to be deemed violative of either of these instruments because of ambiguities within them as to how states are meant to weigh children's rights against their protection. This conclusion is bolstered by the competing provisions of the Convention on the Rights of the Child about protecting children's fundamental rights while also ensuring their health and wellbeing. As such, the PRC's Draft Minor Mode Guidelines are likely to pass without facing significant legal challenges domestically or internationally.","The health and development problems associated with children's excessive screen time and overuse of the internet are real,228 and governments have an affirmative duty to make an effort to protect children from these harms.229 The PRC's Draft Minor Mode Guidelines represent the latest development in a smattering of regulation in this area in the country over the past several years. And while minor mode appears to be a more facially restrictive method of reducing children's screen time than the previous Chinese regulations, it is well-founded in Chinese law. Furthermore, as displayed by the examples of South Korea, Japan, and Taiwan, China's neighbors have all attempted to resolve this issue in a number of ways which, despite differing slightly in substance, are not clearly less restrictive than the PRC's Draft Minor Mode Guidelines. Finally, while various rights of children are certainly implicated by all of the internet use restrictions mentioned in this Comment, current versions of relevant international instruments like the UDHR, the ICCPR, and the CRC all fail to provide a meaningful answer on how governments should balance children's fundamental human rights with protecting children from the real harm that internet overuse can cause to their physical, mental, and emotional wellbeing and development. While this Comment does not take a stance on how international institutions might accomplish this, or on whether they should do so at all, the analysis above depicts a significant gap in the *258 current framework of international human rights when it comes to children and competing interests. As governments continue to adopt new ways of approaching this issue, these ambiguities will continue to lead to confusion and a lack of uniform application of these treaties. The PRC's Draft Minor Mode Guidelines, even at the draft stage, rest on solid legal ground, both domestically and internationally, and they represent a regulatory trend that may continue across the globe as the internet continues to become more and more integral to daily life.230 If there is an international right to the internet embedded in the right to freedom of expression of either customary international law or in one of the international instruments analyzed above, an international body needs to make that clear or at the very least engage with how internet use restrictions for minors interact with such a right.",,"""This Comment attempts to analyze how the Draft Minor Mode Guidelines interact with those rights in the current landscape of Chinese domestic law.

LAW AND POLITICAL POWER STRUCTURE: JUSTICE IN EARLY IMPERIAL CHINA AND ROME,Zhiqiang Wang,"Zhiqiang Wang, Law and Political Power Structure: Justice in Early Imperial China and Rome, 35 Yale J.L. & Human. 626, 626?C27 (2024)",Yale Journal of Law & the Humanities,https://openyls.law.yale.edu/entities/publication/bdacb98b-a6e8-43a3-a293-f133c2383d89,,"Law and politics are closely related. The differences and changes in political factors have direct and profound impacts on law. As a fundamental political element, the political power structure basically has two typical forms, namely, a centralized system and a decentralized system. A centralized system means concentration of political power in both horizontal and vertical dimensions: horizontally, power is held in the hands of chief officials, while vertically, in the central government. By contrast, in a decentralized system, power is dispersed in a manner of pluralism in both dimensions. Through an empirical study of the history of early imperial law, this article compares the different facets of the judicial process that were under the influence of these two typical forms of power structure in ancient societies, tests the thesis in various forms, and thus explains the close relationship between law and politics. The Chinese Qin-Han and Roman Empires co-existed and developed in parallel at the two ends of the Eurasia continent, leaving remarkable legacies on human civilizations, including political and legal systems. Meanwhile, the Roman regime, especially during its imperial period, covers a vast territory comparable to that of early imperial China and shares similarities in terms of size, population, and level of economic development. Therefore, these two systems are ideally comparable in the analysis of causation between politics and law as it is easier to control variables by excluding potential influences from factors other than the political system, which is presumably a key variable in this study. Due to the differences in geographical environments, historical development, and political ideas, the political power structures in early imperial China and the Roman Republic (509 B.C.E.--27 B.C.E) can be taken as the representative institutions, respectively, of centralization and decentralization. The former regime consists of the Qin (221 B.C.E.--206 B.C.E.) and Han (202 B.C.E.--220 C.E.) dynasties. Meanwhile, the Roman *627 system in different periods had significantly more diverse characteristics: deviating from the Republican decentralized system, the Principate (27 B.C.E.--284 C.E.) appeared as a transitional form towards centralization, while the Dominate (284-565) turned to be a quasi-centralized system, which resembles that of early imperial China in many respects. These various patterns along the spectrum are used as ideal examples to verify the impact of political changes upon law and its enforcement. Different political power structures give rise to their corresponding styles of state actions and methods of allocating social resources and thus affect law and judicial practice.1 Under centralized systems such as the Qin-Han Chinese regimes, political power is in the hands of chief officials in a locality, controlled vertically by the central government under the absolutism of monarch. It leads to a strong and active state, a hierarchical control structure, and a mechanism where chief officials take full responsibility. This system generates a strong ability to mobilize and allocate resources, raises a large team of professional bureaucrats, and provides sufficient support for an active state-led judicial system, especially the significant costs required for criminal law enforcement and document-based superior review. By contrast, in a decentralized system, political power is dispersed in both horizontal and vertical dimensions; hence, the government is relatively weak and passive, and the capacity to mobilize resources is limited. Accordingly, governance is typically based on social participation and power balance, which gives rise to party-dominated adversarialism in judicial practice. Adopting the methodology of ideal-type analysis on law and politics,2 this article explores the key elements in the judicial process, including participants, procedural settings, and law application, in different political settings and analyzes the impact of different political power structures in these fields.","As far as the typology of political systems is concerned, the concept of a *642 centralized system is often considered a synonym of oriental despotism,95 a phrase that implies a negative connotation by nature. When comparing centralization with decentralization, it is likely to turn accordingly to a contrast between authoritarianism and liberalism. Nevertheless, a comparison from a social science perspective without ideological bias will shed new light on the understanding of various systems. Firstly, centralization and decentralization are ideal types that do not inherently carry the weight of value judgments. Secondly, the dichotomy of the two types does not mean they are definitely against each other or mutually exclusive. The systems in reality often have certain degrees of hybridity and relativity, as seen in the Roman Principate and Dominate. Many systems in practice, fit in the middle of the spectrum between the two ends of the ideal types. Moreover, the selection and shift between the two types in the real world are the results of social rationality, not necessarily corresponding to certain points on the hierarchical scale of values. Thus, it is not appropriate to label the continental system as inferior simply because it exhibits more characteristics of centralization compared to the Anglo-American system and vice versa, nor is it plausible to claim inherent superiority for the former.
Meanwhile, politics is merely one determinant of legal systems, as many other external factors have varying degrees of influence on law.

An empirical assessment of the law in action during these first two years reveals some troubling deviations from the early promises of the new law on the books. In the first year, a handful of judges were charged with an arduous in-person review process for over 1,000 applicants, and they accepted only twenty-five for case initiation. In the second year, initial case review was delegated to an administrative body--an important efficiency enhancement that tripled the number of opened cases. Nonetheless, most debtors continue to be dissuaded from applying at all, and hundreds of applications have been rejected, in part on the non-statutory grounds that the court is admitting only business-related cases. Moreover, the default gateway of liquidation-and-discharge has been successfully used only once, secretly relegated to ??last resort?? status. Debtors are effectively limited to proposing that creditors accept a payment plan offering full repayment of principal within five years, and creditors have rejected many such plans. While most admitted restructuring cases have led to confirmed plans, many of these ??successes?? are built on very shaky foundations that portend likely struggle and repeat default ahead. The new system, thus, seems to be operating in quite a skewed fashion: admitting only a very small fraction of applicants and offering relief on narrow and demanding grounds.

While the law in books could support a world-class insolvency relief system, the Shenzhen Bankruptcy Court's constricted and conservative interpretation has rendered it largely a dead letter. Effectively the opposite of the consumer bankruptcy regime in Taiwan, the Shenzhen regime in operation cannot be called a ??consumer?? bankruptcy system; it is only a partial ??personal?? bankruptcy regime restricted to current or former entrepreneurs (with a sufficient current connection to Shenzhen). Indeed, it is scarcely a ??bankruptcy?? regime at all, but rather primarily a mechanism for facilitating negotiation of mild interest and penalty concessions.

""Law, Chinese style: solving the authoritarian??s legal dilemma through the private provision of law.""Unpublished manuscript (2020).z",(unpublished),https://papers.sioe.org/paper/2574.html,,"How do authoritarian states build the legal infrastructure of private law (e.g., property rights, contract enforcement) necessary to support efficient markets? Authoritarians typically undersupply this infrastructure due to an ??authoritarian??s legal dilemma??: ho","In this paper, we explore the authoritarians legal dilemma, which refers to the desire to develop private law to govern commerce without creating an independent judicial system capable of challenging the state. In the case of law, Chinese style, the government has opportunistically if subtly embraced the development of law by key private actors. Online market platforms are central to this process, building digital online economic institutions that evolve rapidly and can easily be scaled up. These platforms hence have established a national market with legal infrastructure that the central government has found it difficult to provide. 
Assuming that this experiment succeeds in some form, China will have provided a novel solution to the authoritarians legal dilemma  allowing the creation of an online system of private law that is difficult to expand into public law. In fact, the rise of private legal systems in online markets may even delay the formal development of public law. The data accumulated from this private legal system makes it possible for the state to strengthen its surveillance apparatus. 
Law, Chinese style is not without limitations. The outsourcing of legal development is still limited in scope (i.e., restricted to certain areas of private law). Taobaos private legal system remains in the shadow of political power. Its existence still relies on maintaining a benign relationship with the state, although various costs of intervention can constrain the states arbitrary acts to some extent. Moreover, although Taobaos private legal system is largely algorithm based, there is still room for corruption and nepotism between the users and the platform employees who enforce the rules. Competition among platforms can contain, but not eradicate, the potential abuse of power by business elites.  Lastly, the emergence of law, Chinese style marks a partial shift from human enforcement to digital enforcement of market rules. While digital enforcement decreases the chance of human errors and manipulation, algorithms themselves are not free of problems such as algorithmic bias and interpretability issues.                                
We are well aware of these limitations. By no means are we suggesting that law, Chinese style is a Pareto-efficient or normatively-superior approach to developing a legal market infrastructure. Nor do we contend that government-initiated legal reforms are unnecessary. Rather, we posit that law, Chinese style presents one of the few options to strike a balance between economic efficiency and political feasibility, which is important for legal development in authoritarian countries. Essentially, our theory proposes a ??second-best institution,?? which, according to Rodrik,  is more appropriate for the developing world than the alleged ??best-practice institutions,?? since political barriers cannot be easily tackled in the short term.
Importantly, law, Chinese style implies a new governance model, which we call ??private governance under state oversight.??

In this article, I draw on stories in Chinese villages under the one-child policy to suggest that the lack of moral legitimacy in a particular law motivates people to help others overcome legal or policy restrictions, especially when there are existing connections and trust among them. It reveals the influential impact of law's moral legitimacy on people's responses to legal evasion and the relational nature of legal consciousness. An individual's existing connections with and trust in those who evade the law often reinforce the sense of obligation to take matters into one's own hands to help right the wrong that has been done to them. Nevertheless, the consequences of participating in such collusion may reshape expectations and obligations within the community, pushing law-evading citizens to minimize risks for those who are willing to facilitate their evasion of the law. The fluid nature of interpersonal relationships in Chinese society also means that when things go wrong, supportive members may in turn use their insider information against the law-evading citizen to seek revenge or teach them a lesson.
In 1989, Mingna, a six-year-old girl, never had a good night's sleep. Mingna's mother was pregnant again after having four daughters. Officials from the township often raided in the middle of the night to arrest women with extra-plan pregnancies and their family members due to their violation of the one-child policy. Determined to have a son, Mingna's family spent the nights here and there with relatives who were willing to have them for a night or two. Mingna felt safer in the daytime, as she believed village fellows would watch out for them. Sometimes, the village cadres notified the family in advance to allow them some time to run away.
??Village cadres and fellows are all our relatives to some extent. We all carry the same surname and interact with one another every day. People in this village were reluctant to report extra-plan pregnancies,?? sai","Stories of legal collusion under the one-child policy have demonstrated how relational legal consciousness is formed and sustained within social groups, even to the point where people are willing to facilitate others' evasion of the law. In general, people are prepared to take matters into their own hands to help their group members when the law is illegitimate. Legal collusion will most likely take place when two inseparable factors are both present: the law's lack of moral legitimacy; and a zijiren relationship between the colluding parties. The two factors are inextricably connected, and missing either of the two will significantly reduce the chance for legal collusion. In other words, an illegitimate law alone will not necessarily result in collusion when there are no zijiren relationships involved; and the existence of zijiren relationships alone does not guarantee legal collusion.
At the same time, while those who evade the law can expect a certain level of protection from group members because of existing connections with them and the law's lack of moral legitimacy, they should never take kindness and support for granted. This is especially the case when the imposition of collective responsibility and financial incentives has the potential to unsettle preexisting expectations among community members. Those who evade the law have the responsibility to create opportunities for legal collusion by providing seemingly convincing evidence and absorbing the negative impacts themselves.
Things become more complicated when there are more than two parties involved. For example, village fellows were simultaneously zijiren to the couple who evaded the law and the village cadre born and raised in the same village. A balance had to be reached when a particular zijiren's evasion of the law had a negative impact on another zijiren. This complexity reminds law and society scholars of the need to look beyond the relationship between the parties directly involved in legal collusion and pay close attention to other people who may be affected directly or indirectly.
It is generally safe for an individual to assume some level of protection from zijiren when the individual puts in the effort to minimize the negative impact on other community members who help with the evasion of the illegitimate law. But things did not always work out as expected. After all, envy, disputes, and conflicts are inevitable in close communities such as small villages in rural Fujian. Community members can in turn use the insider information to report those who evade the law as a way to seek revenge, teach somebody a lesson, or even just for personal interests such as monetary rewards and promotions. Thus, people who evade a particular piece of morally illegitimate law should stay alert and try their best to avoid attention from community members.
This study uses stories under the one-child policy to discuss the factors that contribute to legal collusion, the importance of taking responsibility and creating opportunities for other community members to participate in legal collusion, and the *2070 uncertainty of legal collusion due to the fluid nature of interpersonal relationships. The findings of the analysis of thin legal collusion in this article have broader implications within and outside Chinese societies. The article offers a theoretical framework to discuss the reasons behind people's tolerance and facilitation of other people's evasion of the law in different cultural contexts. While zijiren and guanxi are indeed concepts unique to Chinese societies and cannot be applied directly to study groups of non-Chinese people, it is reasonable to assume that interpersonal relationships within a real or imagined group and attitudes toward the law's moral legitimacy inevitably affect people's legal consciousness in other cultural contexts. It is not a matter of whether these two factors shape legal collusion or not, but rather a matter of degree.",,"""Under what circumstances are people willing to remain silent or help those who are evading the law even if they do not financially benefit from the legal evasion? What are the factors that shape a person's willingness to facilitate some people's evasion of the law and not that of others?""
""Under what circumstances did legal collusion occur under the one-child policy? How did people increase the chance of legal collusion by creating opportunities for village fellows to remain silent or offer support in small ways?""","""Legal collusion will most likely take place when two inseparable factors are both present: the law's lack of moral legitimacy; and a zijiren relationship between the colluding parties. The two factors are inextricably connected, and missing either of the two will significantly reduce the chance for legal collusion. In other words, an illegitimate law alone will not necessarily result in collusion when there are no zijiren relationships involved; and the existence of zijiren relationships alone does not guarantee legal collusion.""
""Stories of legal collusion under the one-child policy have demonstrated how relational legal consciousness is formed and sustained within social groups, even to the point where people are willing to facilitate others' evasion of the law.

The natural next question is how, when a judge is improperly influenced, he or she reasons to justify a biased decision. In a set of experiments using incumbent Chinese judges, we first replicated the findings of previous studies that showed judges can be influenced by extra-legal factors. More importantly, we showed that judges may employ a range of legal techniques to rationalize decision biases: they interpret legal standards and legal concepts strategically, finesse the applicability of law, infer or deny causation and foreseeability, and draw different conclusions from facts. Our findings provide a more realistic understanding of how judges behave, and cast doubt on reasoned elaboration as a guarantee of judicial transparency and trustworthiness.","Llewellyn (1931) critically argued that rule of law has never really existed because judges have always made law themselves, using rules to make their decisions seem plausible. Reasoned elaboration in the judicial decision-making process has been thought to constrain judicial arbitrariness and safeguard judicial transparency and trustworthiness (Fuller 1978; Hart & Sacks 1994; Waldron 2011). In this article, however, we find that judges can use reasons to incorporate their personal feelings. We provide evidence that they do so using a wide range of legal techniques and in many areas of the law: from interpreting legal standards to deciding applicability of law and from inferring causation to confirming mere facts. Our findings cast doubt on the effectiveness of reasoned elaboration as a means to ensure judicial transparency, and provide a more realistic understanding of how judges behave.

The Code has three rules for liquidated damages. The first rule gives contracting parties the freedom to agree on this remedy and enjoy its convenience and clarity. It reduces the burden of proof, saves judicial resources, and respects freedom of contract. The second rule lets contracting parties request the courts to increase or reduce pre-set amounts that are disproportionate to the losses caused by breaches. This unique and flexible mechanism balances justice for both contracting sides, guarantees the validity of liquidated damages, advances respect for contractual freedom, makes this remedy more compensatory, and introduces benefits that other jurisdictions lack.
However, the third rule is defective, unjustifiably imposing different liabilities on those delaying contract performance compared to other breaches.

It found subsections 585(1) and 585(2) are well justified, reinforcing the legitimacy of these two rules. In particular, the flexible mechanism established by subsection 585(2) is unique in Chinese law and can introduce benefits that other jurisdictions lack.
Notwithstanding this, subsection 585(3) was found to be defective. This Article scrutinized the academic and historical causes of the problem, dissected those causes, and proposed a legal reform to solve the problem. Further, this Article proposed another reform to fill the gap in the Civil Code and end the nationwide contradictory judgments in relation to an important matter about the concurrency of liquidated damages and contractual damages. These two reforms endeavor to eliminate the confusion and gap caused by the NPC for more than twenty years. The ultimate purpose is to *489 refine the rules of liquidated damages and make them more coherent, powerful, and effective. The two recommendations for reform could be submitted to and considered by the NPC when the NPC next decides to amend the Civil Code.

LIQUIDITY EFFECTS OF LITIGATION RISK: EVIDENCE FROM A LEGAL SHOCK,"Tommaso Oliviero, Min Park, Hong Zou","Tommaso Oliviero et. al., Liquidity Effects of Litigation Risk: Evidence from A Legal Shock, 67 J.L. & Econ. 103 (2024)",Journal of Law & Economics,https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/727345,https://doi.org/10.1086/727345,"Theory offers two diverging views on the effects of ex ante litigation risk on corporate liquidity proxied by cash holdings. Ex ante litigation risk, however, is difficult to measure. We test the liquidity effects of ex ante litigation risk by exploiting the phase-by-phase introduction of securities class actions (SCAs) in Korea. Following the increase in litigation risk, firms significantly increase their internal liquidity, especially those without directors' and officers' liability insurance and those that are financially constrained. The results hold robustly in difference-in-differences and regression discontinuity designs. We also find that the increase in ex ante SCA risk improves firms' stock market liquidity and valuation, especially for firms that do not carry liability insurance. Taken together, the results are consistent with the arguments that SCAs increase firms' liability risk and lower investors' risk.","There are two opposing theoretical arguments on the effects of ex ante litigation risk on firms' internal liquidity: the precautionary saving motive, which predicts that firms may hoard more cash in response to higher ex ante litigation risk, and the strategic motive, which posits that firms may strategically reduce cash holdings to reduce the appeal to potential litigants and/or secure an advantageous bargaining position in litigation. Reflecting this theoretically ambiguous link between litigation risk and cash holdings, Crane (2011) and Arena and Julio (2015) report mixed evidence.
We investigate the effects of ex ante litigation risk on corporate liquidity by exploiting the passage of a law in 2003 that introduced SCAs in Korea. The law's phase-by-phase implementation results in a clear control group before 2007. Examining 3 years before and after the law was passed, the DID analysis shows that treatment firms hoard more cash as a response to the higher SCA risk. This result is more consistent with the precautionary saving motive than the strategic motive. The increase in liquidity is concentrated in treatment firms that carried no D&O insurance coverage before the law's change and is more pronounced in *137 firms that had more volatile cash flows or were financially constrained before the change in the law. Using matched control firms and an RDD analysis exploiting the variations in firms within the narrow band of the asset threshold prescribed by the law yields similar results.
We then extend the analysis from firms' internal liquidity to stock market liquidity and stock valuation. The SCA risk may result in higher stock liquidity and a higher valuation through the ex ante governance effect and the ex post loss-compensation effect, which increases the confidence of uninformed investors in a firm and likely lowers the price discount uninformed investors impose on the firm's stocks. On the other hand, the introduction of SCAs may lower firms' valuation because firms exposed to SCA risk tend to hoard more cash that cannot be used for productive investments or investors anticipate firms' need to pay out cash to some aggrieved parties who are no longer shareholders in the event of an SCA suit. Higher litigation risk may also result in more costly debt financing. Both stock liquidity and firm valuation increase after the introduction of SCAs in firms that are not protected by D&O insurance. The evidence speaks to the net benefits of SCAs and the attenuating effects of D&O insurance. We also test the theoretically ambiguous effects of SCA risk on corporate investment and find that the net effect is statistically insignificant.
Overall, we provide novel causal evidence of ex ante shareholder litigation risk on liquidity effects (both internal and external) and relatedly the effects on firm valuation. The study extends the literature that has thoroughly investigated the effects of litigation on the firms being sued or their peers and the mixed results on the effects of ex ante litigation risk on corporate liquidity. It also extends prior studies examining the effects of variation in country-level protection for investors on stock liquidity by providing evidence on the effects of protection for investors within a country.
It is worth pointing out that while the phase-in application of the 2003 SCA Act to firms with different asset sizes in Korea enables us to perform a DID analysis and an RDD analysis, a limitation is that the control group is potentially subject to the anticipation effect and therefore not free from the influence of SCAs. A further limitation for the external validity of the analysis is that the treatment sample is composed of a small number of the largest Korean companies. The limitations leave room for further research on the effects of SCAs in other jurisdictions.",,"""how do firms' internal liquidity or cash holdings1 respond to the perceived increase in litigation risk (or ex ante litigation risk)?""

Since President Barack Obama's ??pivot to Asia,?? there has been renewed attention on growing Chinese naval power and influence, which stands to challenge the U.S. status as the world's preeminent naval force. Despite a clear and obvious interest in maintaining a favorable global oceans regime, the United States has not ratified the United Nations C","The reach of the modern law of the sea can be dizzying. It exists on a foundation of both customary international law and conventional treaty law. It implicates everything from national security to trade, fishing, energy, the environment, and individual enjoyment of the oceans. And it occupies a rare status in international relations as practically all States recognize the clear benefit and need of legal standardization.
If past is prologue, there is little doubt that the global oceans will continue to be a central arena of great power competition--and the SCS will be its main stage. As powers vie for influence in the SCS, as emerging technologies and geopolitical winds shift, and as the law develops to keep pace, tensions will remain. In particular, as competing superpowers, the United States and China, maneuver to entrench their visions of the rules governing the global oceans, their navies, diplomats, and proxies will be placed in uncomfortably close quarters. To repurpose the proverbial sentiment, when great ships play chicken the wake disrupts the sea. A single strategic miscalculation or tactical misstep when navigating these tensions could lead to disastrous consequences. Getting it right is important.
The U.S. position on the law of the sea stands on shaky legs. The United States cannot rely on customary law to protect key U.S. FON provisions. Customary law is inherently indeterminate, volatile, and subject to reinterpretation. Ratification bypasses these shortcomings by providing a firm legal foundation with embedded dispute settlement mechanisms, which together offer stability, predictability, and a rule set that is remarkably favorable to U.S. interests.
Of course, opponents raise valid concerns. Ratification would subject the United States to international courts, but the benefits of having recourse to a *991 court with the jurisdiction to peacefully settle disputes has been undervalued. Far from being an abdication of congressional responsibility or a degradation of U.S. sovereignty, ratification would amplify the voice of U.S. policymakers to shape the law and to express and protect U.S. interests. Ratification would open the doors to important venues for U.S. leadership, thereby augmenting, not undermining, sovereignty.
After all, given that the United States already abides by the treaty provisions, formal accession to the treaty would signal to the world that U.S.-styled FON is and will continue to be the global norm.
In sum, global oceans challenges will continue to complicate U.S. interests and security. The law, the world, and the sea are all rapidly changing. The question is, will the United States be positioned to effectively cope? Although at one point ratifying UNCLOS may have threatened U.S. interests, the strategic environment has shifted. Today, it is not ratifying that carries the greater risk.","international law, Law of the Sea, national security law","""This Note explores the legal context of U.S. nonmembership and analyzes its implications along three axes: U.S. rights and obligations, access to effective dispute settlement mechanisms, and the ability to shape future developments of the law of the sea.""","""It concludes that relying on customary international law without being party to UNCLOS is not sufficient to guarantee the foundation of the U.S. Freedom of Navigation policy.

Most foreign companies chose to establish Sino-foreign joint ventures consisting of two or more partners, usually a foreign company that was either U.S.-based or multinational, and a local Chinese company.7 For a U.S. company, a joint venture would be appealing because of the local partner's understanding of Chinese culture and its ability to navigate China's complex laws and politics.8 The local partner was usually a state-owned enterprise--a business entity owned by the state and under the control of the Communist Party.9 Further, most of China's industrial sectors were legally inaccessible to foreign companies in the absence of an established joint venture with a local partner.10 Thus, joint ventures with Chinese partners granted foreign companies the ability to do business in certain highly lucrative industries. As of the first quarter of 2022, there were approximately 124,600 Sino-foreign joint ventures in China. All prior laws governing joint ventures lapsed when the FIL and the Foreign Investment Law Implementing Regulations (FILIR) came into effect on January 1, 2020.12 All previously established joint ventures under the prior legal regime became subject to the FIL, P.R.C.

The reform's agenda was essentially aimed at professionalization: by edging out a given percentage of judges, only the better qualified judges would be re-appointed to create a more professionalized judiciary.

OLD WINE IN A NEW BOTTLE? - AN EMPIRICAL EVALUATION OF THE JUDICIAL REFORMS IN CHINA IN THE 2010S,Peter C.H. Chan,"Peter C.H.

Rev. 87 (2024)",UC Law SF International Law Review,https://repository.uclawsf.edu/hastings_international_comparative_law_review/vol47/iss2/4/,,"This article provides an empirical evaluation of the effectiveness of the judicial reform measures implemented in China in the 2010s. Among other objectives, the reforms aimed to strengthen the independence of judges, the financial autonomy of courts and the professionalism of adjudicators. Critics have questioned the success of the reforms, citing continued government intervention with adjudication and unchanged structural problems with courts. To date, there has been limited empirical literature focusing specifically on the judicial reform measures in the 2010s in China. This article provides a glimpse into what really was happening on the ground since the reforms through the lens of frontline judges. It concludes that the reforms have enhanced the financial autonomy of courts, the independence of individual adjudicators and the quality of judgments. 47% of the judges who responded to the survey agreed that the judicial reform was extremely effective. However, this study also reveals that the reforms failed to tackle deep-seated problems of the Chinese judiciary. Local government intervention with adjudication is still rampant. Courts continued to be severely understaffed. Judges are still ready to abridge procedures to arrive at an outcome that is consistent with the policy of the court leadership. While *88 the reform is not ??old wine in a new bottle??, there is still much room for improvement in the administration of justice in China.","Considering China's socio-political constraints and the judiciary's focus on substantive social justice, this article answers whether China's courts have effectively achieved the objectives of the Judicial Reform in the 2010s. The overall objective of the Judicial Reform in the 2010s is the public feels that justice is done in every single court case. This can be translated into seven sub-objectives: (1) courts are more able to adjudicate cases independently than before; (2) the courts have more financial autonomy than before; (3) individual judges are able to adjudicate cases more independently than before; (4) implement the life responsibility system for the judges; (5) implement the judges quota system for the judges; (6) change the quantitative assessment of the judges; and (7) improve the quality of written judgments.
Through an in-depth empirical analysis, this article finds that, overall, the Judicial Reform in the 2010s has been effective in China, but there are some critical limitations. First, despite the impetus of judicial reform, the basic nature of government interference in the courts remains unchanged. The government still maintains considerable power in some sensitive cases *126 and continues to influence the outcome of court cases. This phenomenon suggests that the reform is still, to some extent, influenced by political constraints. Second, the fiscal autonomy of the courts has increased slightly under the judicial reform, but its actual impact has been relatively limited. Fiscal reforms aim to centralise fiscal power at the provincial court level to increase the autonomy of the local courts. However, local governments still maintain their influence by controlling the administrative resources of the courts, resulting in limited local autonomy of the courts. Third, judicial reform enables individual judges to be more independent in adjudicating cases. The introduction of the judges quota system raises the threshold for becoming a judge and simplifies the administrative tasks of judges, contributing to improving the professionalism of judges and reducing unnecessary internal administrative distractions. In addition, the life responsibility of judges requires judges to improve their judicial skills, as they are held personally accountable for their decisions. Fourth, despite some of the benefits of the quota system, the problem of the exodus of judges is progressively worsening due to the life responsibility system and the absence of a matching system of benefits and promotions for judges. Finally, the quality of written judgments has improved because of the judicial reform. The judicial reform encourages judges to pay more attention to the content and quality of written judgments to enhance the judicial transparency and justice. Overall, while positive results have been achieved, the judicial reform still faces many challenges, including government interference and the loss of judges.
Judicial reform in China faces a major obstacle in that judicial culture favours substantive social justice over procedural justice. The roots of this problem are deeply imbued in China's history, culture, and legal traditions, and, therefore, cannot be solved simply through piecemeal reforms. Traditional Chinese legal concepts attach a high degree of importance to the social effects of a case. This emphasis on substantive social justice leads to judicial decisions aim to maintain social stability at the expense of procedural justice. Meanwhile, China's judiciary system is chronically subject to interference from governmental authorities which also undermine procedural justice. To target this problem, future judicial reforms require the joint participation and support of the government and society.","China??s judicial reform, substantive justice, procedural

As decision-making mechanisms for human-machine interaction, algorithms are not value-neutral and should be legally regulated. Algorithm disclosure, personal data empowerment, and anti-algorithmic discrimination are traditional regulatory methods relating to algorithms, but mechanically using these methods presents difficulties in feasibility and desirability. Algorithm disclosure faces difficulties such as technical infeasibility, meaningless disclosure, user gaming and intellectual property right infringement. And personal data empowerment faces difficulties such as personal difficulty in exercising data rights and excessive personal data empowerment, making it difficult for big data and algorithms to operate effectively. Anti-algorithmic discrimination faces difficulties such as non-machine algorithmic discrimination, impossible status neutrality, and difficult realization of social equality. Taking scenarios of algorithms lightly is the root cause of the traditional algorithm regulation path dilemma. Algorithms may differ in attributes due to specific algorithmic subjects, objects and domains involved. Therefore, algorithm regulation should be developed and employed based on a case-by-case approach to the development of accountable algorithms. Following these development principles, specific rules can be enacted to regulate algorithm disclosure, data empowerment, and anti-algorithmic discrimination.

Pandemic State-building: Chinese Administrative Expansion in the Xi Jinping Era,"Yutian An, Taisu Zhang","An, Yutian and Zhang, Taisu, Pandemic State-building: Chinese Administrative Expansion in the Xi Jinping Era (February 12, 2023)",Yale Law & Policy Review,https://yalelawandpolicy.org/pandemic-state-building-chinese-administrative-expansion-2012,,"In 2020, with the onset of the Covid-19 Pandemic, China embarked on one of the largest expansions of administrative capacity in its modern history. Compared to its pre-Covid self, the current Chinese Party-state apparatus can now track and govern individual activity with unprecedented precision and regularity. While some of these developments were emergency measures that were limited to the pandemic, many of them have become institutionally entrenched through generalized lawmaking and policymaking, permanently transforming the Chinese government??s relationship with its population. Most importantly, the Party-state delegated enormous administrative law enforcement and information collection powers to two levels of urban government ?? the ??subdistrict,?? and below it, the ??neighborhood community?? ?? that used to be institutionally marginalized.

This Article is the first systemic study of this paradigmatic transformation. Through a comprehensive analysis of central-level laws, regulations, and policies, paired with local case studies from major cities, it traces the institutional framework and political logic of Chinese administrative expansion. Its core argument is that the sudden onset of Covid-19 forced cohesive action onto a previously internally conflicted political landscape. Chinese leaders had contemplated a sig","In most countries, the onset of the Covid-19 Pandemic led to some form of administrative expansion, if only to enforce the lockdowns that were commonplace globally in 2020 and even 2021. Many, perhaps most, of these countries pursued administrative expansion under the legal framework of emergency powers, which gave governments a temporary boost in control capacity, but also sent a clear signal that there would be, at some point, a reversion back to the institutional status quo. By 2022 or early 2023, administrative powers had indeed reverted back to its pre-pandemic status quo in most Western countrieswith mask mandates removed and declarations of emergency formally terminated. Even in countries like Japan, South Korea, or Singapore, where Covid control measures were significantly stricter than in Europe or North America, policies were unmistakably loosening by 2022, with few signs, if any, of a permanent expansion in administrative power.
From that perspective, the Chinese experience studied in this article is highly unusual: not only were Chinese pandemic controls significantly tighter than in almost any other country, but they produced a large and permanent, rather than merely emergency, increase in the states administrative capacity. The Chinese government certainly made use of emergency laws to justify many of its initial actions, but those actions pale in long-term significance compared to the systemic descension of coercive authority to the lowest tiers of urban governance. It is perhaps tempting to simply attribute this to the Chinese Party-states authoritarian character, but that would overlook the obvious fact that few other authoritarian regimes, if any, appear to have experienced a comparable phase of permanent administrative expansion during the pandemic: not Singapore, not Turkey, not Russia, not Vietnam.
In fact, without the institutional groundwork that had already been laid between 2012 and 2019, it is rather doubtful that the pandemic could have produced such a permanent administrative expansion even in China. It is worth noting that previous large-scale Chinese governmental responses to infectious diseases??for example, the SARS outbreak of 2003??produced nothing of the sort. Covid-19 hit China precisely at a major institutional juncture where the Party leadership was thinking serious","Administrative State, Local Governance, Covid-19, China, Urban Governments","""This Article is the first systemic study of this paradigmatic transformation.

Even so, it would be a mistake to simply attribute the scope and thoroughness of recent developments to the pandemic alone. The existence of pre-pandemic deliberations was also crucially important, in the sense that it allowed pandemic-era pressures to strengthen pre-existent political possibilities, rather than having to construct them from scratch.""",,Doctrinal Legal Research,,unsure: analyzes Chinese admin hierarchy since 2012,N: focuses solely on China,Y: combines law and political science,principal agent problems,,,"2.

However, little is understood about the characteristics of policy experimentation, and how the structure of experimentation may affect policy learning and policy outcomes. We aim to describe and understand China??s policy experimentation since 1980, among the largest and most systematic in recent history. We collect comprehensive data on policy experimentation conducted in China over the past four decades. We find three main results. First, more than 80% of the experiments exhibit positive sample selection in terms of a locality??s economic development, and much of this can be attributed","In this project, we systematically examine Chinas policy experimentation over the past four decades, one of the largest undertakings of systematic policy learning in recent history. We present three sets of results. First, policy experimentation sites are substantially positively selected, and misaligned incentives across political hierarchies account for much of the observed positive selection. Second, experimental situation during policy experimentation is unrepresentative: local politicians exert strategic efforts and allocate more resources during experimentation that may exaggerate policy effectiveness. Third, the positive sample selection and unrepresentative experimental situation are not fully accounted for when the central government evaluates experimentation outcomes, which would bias policy learning and national policies originated from the experiments.
We highlight that policy learning and policy experimentation inevitably take place in complex environments with various constraints and distortions. The political and bureaucratic environment could affect the initiation of policy experimentation, its structure and implementation, and the bias in the information one may gather from an experiment. Our findings stand in contrast with theoretical work analyzing experimentation in federalist environments featuring voluntary local initiatives (Mukand and Rodrik 2005; Callander and Harstad 2015; Myerson 2015). While misaligned incentives between the central and local governments generate sub-optimal learning, rather than the informational free-riding and under-experimentation observed in federalist systems, political centralization in a context such as China, where local governments compete and differentiate in order to increase their chances of promotion, could induce over-experimentation.

Instead, the authors will focus on the most common crime for which petitioners are charged, creating a disturbance. According to Article 293 of the Criminal Law, a person who commits any of the following acts of creating a disturbance, thus undermining the social order, shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment, criminal detention, or community correction. These actions include (1) beating another person; (2) chasing, intercepting, insulting, or intimidating another person; (3) forcible extortion or destroying public or private property; or (4) rampaging in a public place.

Originating from the crime of hooliganism (Aj) in the 1979 Criminal Law, the statute of creating a disturbance was first enacted in the 1997 Amendment of Criminal Law with the purpose of sanctioning hooligans and bullies who intentionally harass people for no justifiable reason.Footnote24 Dubbed a pocket statute, it has been blamed for its over-generalized scope and ambiguous terminology.Footnote25 Although the Supreme Peoples Court (hereinafter as the SPC) and the Supreme Peoples Procuratorate jointly published a judicial interpretation in 2013 to narrow the scope of this crime,Footnote26 judges and prosecutors retain much discretion in adjudication.

The authors have tried to identify petitioners cases that are influenced by political pressures by distinguishing petitioning strategies that have political intentions from routine disruptive tactics that technically fall within the scope of this statute. Similar to the tactical innovation of protesters in social movements, disruptive tactics in petitioning challenge the official definition of legality.Footnote27 They normally entail varying degrees of violence, including beating, intimidating, extorting and rampaging that inevitably violate the criminal law.Footnote28 Politicized strategies, in contrast, target the regime??s political concerns instead of contesting the law. To get their complaints treated seriously, petitioners may petition Beijing and other politically sensitive locations; they petition during politically sensitive periods (????????) when major political events are taking place; they draw support from the public and bring mass allies with them when petitioning, turning their visits into political demonstrations.Footnote29 These strategies are hardly punishable under the crime of creating a disturbance; nonetheless, they are included as a part of the factual basis for the judgment.

Work team members are then expected to use their personal influence to persuade relatives, friends and fellow townspeople to stand down. Thought workers with weak ties to protesters are encouraged to work with extra intensity and to rely on people they know with closer connections. Those who fail to transform the protesters they are assigned are often subject to punishment, including suspension of salary, removal from office and prosecution.

Relational repression sometimes works. When the authorities have considerable say over work team members and bonds with protesters are strong, relational repression can help put an end to popular action. Even if thought work does not halt a protest entirely, it can limit its length and scope by reducing tension at times of high strain and providing a channel for negotiation and discussion of possible compromises. Quite often, however, insufficiently tight ties and limited concern with consequences creates a commitment deficit, partly because thought workers recognize their scant effectiveness with many protesters and partly because they anticipate little punishment for failing to demobilize anyone other than a close relative.

During the Huashui protests, thought workers with few ties were ignored and better-connected ones experienced pushback. Many sided with protesters against the polluters and feared being denounced, ostracized, or called traitors. Most thought workers did not throw themselves into their work and a handful refused to do it at all. Despite the rapport some team members had with the tent-sitters, relational repression in Huashui failed and the authorities closed the chemical park to bring an end to the encampment.

Relational repression is not a state policy but a local practice that has become more prominent in an era when maintaining stability is paramount and local leaders are highly motivated to prevent or halt protest. For at least one type of dispute  forced eviction  the State Council has gone as far as to issue an urgent circular banning demolition by implicating homeowners' relatives (zhulian chaiqian *???).Footnote63 Yet relational repression continues and remains common in rural areas (where dense social ties facilitate it) and cities (where many residents still work in units and there is a ready supply of work team members).

People who take part in group protests are not the only victims of relational repression. Individual activists also experience it.Footnote64 Lone petitioners, birth control resisters, human rights campaigners and rights protection lawyers all are subject to relational repression.Footnote65 Among collective protesters, urbanites who live in neighbourhoods slated for demolition and villagers whose land has been requisitioned have been targeted especially often in recent years,Footnote66 and even migrant workers have been singled out, despite difficulties in locating intermediaries to place pressure on them.Footnote67 Elderly protesters appear to be particularly common victims of relational repression, perhaps because it is unseemly to use force on them and it is assumed they will be responsive to importuning by younger relatives.Footnote68

As a form of social control, relational repression harks back to the baojia ?2 system of mutual responsibility in imperial China. The practice of guilt by association reminds us that local authorities have long held the population in check by making relatives, friends, and neighbours responsible for each other. The thought work at the heart of relational repression also resonates with governance practices from China's past. Assembling work teams and descending on villages was a standard policy implementation tool in the Maoist era that has received little attention recently.Footnote69 But grassroots thought work and the sudden appearance of big work teams persists, as leaders still seek to engineer emotions by mixing practical incentives and psychological pressures and tapping a Confucian stress upon social bonds and obligations.Footnote70

The era of large-scale mass movements may be over, but managed campaigns continue in realms as varied as population control, crisis management and economic development.Footnote71 As campaigns have evolved, so too has ground-level thought work. If work teams were once used to overcome inertia, circumvent opposition and mobilize participation, in today's harmonious society (hexie shehui ?>) they are equally often employed to maintain social order and demobilize those who threaten it.

That work teams are used to demobilize protesters also speaks to a large literature on networks and popular action. Many studies have shown that protest recruitment flows along lines of pre-existing social relationshipsFootnote72 as social ties enhance feelings of trust and offer newcomers reassurance,Footnote73 while also providing opportunities to apply subtle forms of pressure (If you go, I'll go, too).Footnote74 Relational repression in China, on the other hand, illustrates how family, friendship and native-place ties are not just pull factorsFootnote75 that draw individuals to popular action; they can also be deployed to push people away from contention. When mobilizing protest, strong, weak and even absent ties can all be exploited;Footnote76 for relational repression, tie strength is key.

Relying on the analytical framework of relative capture, I challenge this assumption by arguing that interest groups have different incentives and capacities to capture different levels of government. I test the theory by investigating how judges at different judicial levels adjudicate corporate lawsuits in China. Exploiting a quasi-experiment in which the Supreme People??s Court dramatically ra","As Rodden (2006, pp. 1-2) remarks, decentralization and the spread of federalism are perhaps the most important trends in governance around the world over the last 50 years. By the end of the 20th century, estimates of the number of decentralization reforms ranged from 80% of the worlds countries to effectively all of them (Manor, 1999). Since then, further reforms have been announced in several dozen countries as diverse as Bolivia, Cambodia, Ethiopia, France, Indonesia, Japan, Peru, South Africa, South Korea, Uganda, and the United Kingdom (Faguet, 2014).
A large literature, however, argues that lower level governments are more susceptible to elite capture. If this presumption is correct, the advantages of decentralizationto bring governments closer to the people, induce competition among local governments, and make it easier for citizens to hold their representatives accountablewould be compromised by local elite capture.34
Many countries, including Vietnam and China, that have experienced the disadvantages of decentralization have begun to recentralize to distance politics from special interests. Both decentralization and recentralization reforms have received financial support from international donors, such as the World Bank, the United Nations Development Program, the European Union, the U.S. Agency for International Development, and the Ford Foundation.35
Despite the enthusiasm and generosity on both sides, prior work has offered contradictory conclusions. While some report that decentralization is associated with lower levels of corruption (Fisman & Gatti, 2002), some find that decentralization facilitates elite capture and creates more opportunities for corruption (Mattingly, 2016; Treisman, 2000). Many developing countries lack a straightforward formula and have thus become trapped in what Baum terms tightening/loosening cycles: centralizing, decentralizing, and then going back to square one (Baum, 1996).
My study helps reconcile this controversy. I argue that the framework of relative capture is useful in examining politicians and interest groups incentives at different levels of government. The key insight is that a political hierarchy can be relatively captured by different interest groups at different levels. I then use a novel data set of real court cases disclosed by Chinese publicly traded firms to show that cases brought by different firms win at different rates at different court levels. The Chinese tax structure shapes judges preferences: Courts favor firms that pay taxes to the territorial party-state. Exploiting a quasi-experiment in which the Supreme Court dramatically raised the monetary threshold for cases to enter higher level courts, which created exogenous variation in cases exposure to various levels of courts, I estimate the treatment effect of judicial level on judicial outcomes. I demonstrate that while SOEs are more likely to win in intermediate courts, non-SOEs are more likely to win in basic courts. I employ qualitative interviews to substantiate my proposed mechanisms.
My findings generate a policy implication. Politicians and policy makers who want to reduce capture in their countries should carefully examine the relative strength of major interest groups vis-??-vis different levels of government. In countries where the level of economic development is low and most interest groups are small and local, centralization is often effective in reducing local c",,"Therefore, we need a general theory about who captures what level of government??and why.",My study helps reconcile this controversy. I argue that the framework of relative capture is useful in examining politicians?? and interest groups?? incentives at different levels of government. The key insight is th,,Empirical (Mixed),Dataset analysis,N,N,N,"Following Hellman et al. (2003), I define capture as a situation in which firms use their influence to shape the rules of the game or how games are played. Previous work has assumed that interest groups are more likely to capture lower rather than higher level governments because lobbying local governments is less costly. To influence higher level governments, interest groups need to overcome daunting collective action problems as the issue at stake becomes more complicated and bureaucratic layers multiply. This assumption of local capture is reflected in classic principalagent models in which the principal values general welfare, whereas the agent caters to special interests (Fudenberg & Tirole, 1991).
Interest groups, however, can reap more benefits by capturing higher level governments. Higher level governments make and enforce policies within a larger geographic area, and thus can break local boundaries and grant interest groups preferential treatment to a greater extent. By capturing higher level bureaucracy, interest groups can expand their rent-seeking activities to a larger administrative area or even the whole country. For many firms, the benefits of lobbying higher level governments outweigh the higher costs. So interest groups with different capacities and incentives can capture different levels of politics.
Bardhan and Mookherjee (2000) develop a framework of relative capture based on a model of electoral competition that is subject to the influence of special interest groups. In their basic setup, two parties are competing, and their policy platforms are influenced by campaign contributions from a lobby. The model generates the conditions under which capture is more likely to occur at the local or higher levels. One condition relates to interest groups?? incentives and capacity to influence elections at different levels. For example, under majoritarian electoral systems, only the dominant party wins and gains representation in national policy making, politicians rely more on campaign contributions to win, and interest groups have higher stakes in the election, which creates greater capture at the national level.

Responsive or Repressive? How Frontline Bureaucrats Enforce the One Child Policy in China,Daniel Mattingly,"Daniel C. Mattingly, Responsive or Repressive?

In this article, I examine the implementation of the One Child Policy in China, which has had an enormous impact on Chinese society and yet has received little attention from political scientists. I argue that the success or failure of the policy hinged on using frontline bureaucrats to infiltrate society. Important theories suggest that bureaucratic penetration may increase bureaucrats' responsiveness to citizens and decrease implementation of the law. Drawing on a unique dataset and natural experiment, I show the opposite to be true in China: a one standard deviation increase in bureaucratic penetration lowers over-quota births by 2 to 7 percentage points. There is suggestive evidence that bureaucrats leverage their social embeddedness to control society. The article shows how frontline bureaucrats beyond the police, military, or ruling party are key agents of repression and political control.","A trope in some novels and movies about life under autocracy is that when bureaucrats become familiar with the people they govern, it makes them more sympathetic and more willing to defy the state to protect them. In the movie The Lives of Others, for example, a Stasi agent conducts intense surveillance of a suspected dissident writer in East Germany, and the time he spends spying on the writer and learning about his life gradually turns him into a secret ally of the dissident. In the conclusion of the movie, he risks his career and freedom to help the dissident escape the clutches of the Stasi. Social science theories about social embeddedness provide some support for the implication of this portrait of bureaucratic politics. Being more deeply embedded in local society might induce bureaucrats to be more responsive to the people they serve.
In contrast, this article suggests that increased state penetration can strengthen the ability of authoritarian states to control society, in part because greater familiarity can make frontline bureaucrats more effective agents of the state. In the long run, however, this strategy likely may have its limits. In the appendix, I present results indicating that greater state penetration is correlated with lower levels of satisfaction with the government (see Table A3).
What are the scope conditions of these findings? The implementation of the One Child Policy is a symbol of state capacity in China, which is often held up as an especially important example of a high capacity authoritarian state.63 The general pattern of using frontline bureaucrats to monitor and control behavior is used in other political arenas in China, and in other authoritarian regimes, especially for policies in which there is a mismatch between local preferences and state mandates. These might include family planning policy implementation in other states, such as India, Iran, or Indonesia. Recent scholarship has shown how the Chinese state uses street-level bureaucrats who are embedded in local social networks to expropriate land, repress protest, and monitor civil society groups.64
However, the findings are unlikely to travel to policy areas where there is a potential for local officials to capture rents if they refrain from implementing policies. Work by Mertha on intellectual property rights enforcement in China provides an important example, where penetration by the Administration for Industry and Commerce to local levels increases its power and authority, but also provides an opportunity for bureaucrats to seek rents and look the other way when they observe violations of the law in order to protect a source of government revenue.65
More work needs to be done to understand the role of gender in enforcement of the One Child Policy and, more generally, politics in China and other authoritarian regimes. Koss finds suggestive evidence that female cadres may undermine enforcement of the One Child Policy, a finding that requires further elaboration and exploration.
The findings also suggest a need to continue to study street-level bureaucrats in authoritarian regimes. In China, recent work has shown how the CCP is highly responsive to citizen requests; however, it remains less clear when this responsiveness translates to changed policy enforcement, especially at the grassroots level, where decisions are made with important implications for the everyday lives of citizens. The teachers, case officers, lower-level bureaucrats, and ward leaders who interact with the citizens of authoritarian regimes every day play an important role in authoritarian monitoring and feedback, but one which recent studies have only begun to explore.",,"What explains the implementation of the One Child Policy in China?

demands.7 Most relevant to the present study, work by Daniel Koss finds that a higher
density of Chinese Communist Party (CCP) cadres is associated with weaker
enforcement of birth quotas since, he argues, party cadres have an interest in being
more tolerant when it comes to sanctioning surplus children.
8 These theories suggest
that when bureaucracies deeply penetrate society, it makes frontline bureaucrats more
responsive to their constituents.
In contrast to these theories, I find that deeper penetration by street-level
bureaucrats helped the state infiltrate society and strengthened the implementation of the
One Child Policy, which was relatively unpopular in rural China. Enforcement of family
planning policies in China??s villages relied on the leaders of ??villager small groups,??
who monitored their neighbors, pressured women to get check-ups at state family
planning stations, and, if necessary, induced them to undergo medical procedures like
sterilization.9 Drawing on a unique dataset, I show that a one standard deviation

In this manuscript, I suggest we return to the crime control model and make the following contributions. First, I have aimed to explain the detriment to innocent people of overstating the severity of type one errors. The Blackstonian philosophy of criminal justice overstates the protection of the innocent, while experience tells us that the Blackstonian ratio is not useful in this context. We need to reflect not just on the hardship of exoneration, but why theorists and the publics outrage have not reduced unnecessary incarceration, and why it is so hard for innocent people to challenge incorrect verdicts after trial. The more we speak about what is worse, the more difficult it becomes to save the innocent, while the less importance we place on sanctioning the guilty, the more danger there is to the community. This arises because, while a paradox that is different from our perceptions ??helps us make sense of the world, it can actively undermine our ability to understand it??.163

The second contribution of this research is the evidence supporting the theoretical argument that it is necessary to focus on the detriment of wrongful liberty and to justify the crime control model. Criminals who have been wrongly freed may have the chance to commit more crime and endanger the community. When ",,"My main areas of focus are: (i) what type of error the public is more likely to support (convicting an innocent person or letting a guilty person go free); (ii) whether the public is more concerned with due process, crime control, or both; (iii) whether public attitudes towards the steps the authorities should be able to take affects their choice of judicial preference; (iv) what commonalities and differences may be observed across years and countries, and what interpretations can be drawn from these observations; and (v) what criminal policy and criminal justice theory should learn from public opinion and the changes across countries."," My analysis shows that (i) the public supports the authorities in taking action against criminals and terrorists without a court order, though in different proportions depending on the specific means at hand; (ii) the apparent paradox of public support for the elegance of due process and fear of crime can be explained by the difficult reality of controlling criminals; (iii) absolute proponents consider type one errors to be worse and thus will not support any measures being taken, while absolute proponents consider type two errors to be worse and steps therefore need to be taken to prevent communities from the risk from crime or terrorist attacks; (iv) members of the public who favour proactive policing are significantly less likely to consider type one errors to be worse than type two; and (v) citizens across countries share the above features in a longitudinal survey.

",American Journal of Political Science,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/15405907,https://doi-org.proxy.lib.duke.edu/10.1111/ajps.12207,"A growing body of research suggests that authoritarian regimes are responsive to societal actors, but our understanding of the sources of authoritarian responsiveness remains limited because of the challenges of measurement and causal identification. By conducting an online field experiment among 2,103 Chinese counties, we examine factors that affect officials' incentives to respond to citizens in an authoritarian context. At baseline, we find that approximately one-third of county governments respond to citizen demands expressed online. Threats of collective action and threats of tattling to upper levels of government cause county governments to be considerably more responsive, whereas identifying as loyal, long-standing members of the Chinese Communist Party does not increase responsiveness. Moreover, we find that threats of collective action make local officials more publicly responsive. Together, these results demonstrate that top-down mechanisms of oversight as well as bottom-up societal pressures are possible sources of authoritarian responsiveness.","Using an online field experiment to directly measure the responsiveness of subnational officials to citizen requests, we find that almost one-third of county governments in China are responsive to citizen requests related to social welfare. We find that threatening collective action causes a 10 percentage point increase in the overall response rate (or a 30% increase in the overall response rate), a 10 percentage point increase in the probability of providing a publicly viewable response, and a 6 percentage point increase in receiving direct, detailed responses. In contrast, while threatening to complain to upper levels of government causes a 8 percentage point increase in overall responsiveness, these threats of tattling have no detectable causal effect on publicly viewable responses. Finally, deferential claims of long-standing loyalty to the CCP do not on average cause increases in responsiveness.

While the Chinese regime may be particularly sensitive to citizen engagement and while the Chinese state may have outsized capacity to engage in information gathering and to respond to societal actors compared to other authoritarian regimes, responsiveness is an increasingly familiar refrain heard among state actors across many authoritarian regimes. Whether it is driven by a concern for regime stability or due to the influence of international organizations, regimes from the Middle East and North Africa to East and Southeast Asia are increasingly stressing the importance of responsiveness and some form of accountability to citizens (Harris 2013; Malesky and Schuler 2010; Reilly 2013).30 For scholars focused on other regions of the world, our work shows that in the absence of meaningful electoral competition, responsiveness could stem from top-down mechanisms of oversight, which we may expect in authoritarian regimes with higher degrees of top-down control and discipline, but responsiveness could also stem from bottom-up pressures from citizen engagement through channels set up by the regime (in our case, forums on government websites). Furthermore, our work shows that top-down mechanisms of oversight are activated by citizen input, that it is the interactions between top-down mechanisms of oversight and citizen engagement that generate authoritarian responsiveness, pointing to a possible refinement of existing theories. Upper-level authorities use citizens as an oversight mechanism on subnational officials, which imbues citizens with the ability to sanction lower-level officials and generates responsiveness among local officials to citizen demands.

These results show that regardless of whether responsiveness derives from top-down mechanisms or bottom-up pressures, citizen engagement is consequential. Citizen engagement provides information that officials pay attention to, and it can result in greater levels of governmental attention and response. Uncontrolled engagement is often a concern for authoritarian regimes, and authoritarian responsiveness appears to be one attempt at diffusing societal tensions and maintaining regime durability.",,"However, we know relatively little about why authoritarian regimes respond, and what mechanisms influence the interactions between these regimes and citizens.

Based on in-depth interviews, it finds that despite the generally tightening political control over the social sector, the reforms have helped some law-related NGOs expand their litigation practice, social and legislative influence, and domestic funding sources. At the same time, these changes have had considerable cooptation effects by aligning these NGOs' interests with the state's and channeling their activities into state-sanctioned institutional processes. The findings suggest that states can effectively utilize a dualist strategy that combines restrictive and supportive approaches to public participation in the legal process. It thus sheds light on the progression of legality within various political and institutional contexts.","The current research presents a picture of China selectively improving the legal opportunity for various types of law-related NGOs. This has been achieved mostly through a recent series of legal reforms under the umbrella of law-based governance, a central element of the current administrations agenda. Chief among these reforms is the new PIL standing bestowed by the 2014 Revision to the Environmental Protection Law, which enables large environmental NGOs to significantly expand their litigation practices. Other substantive legislationsuch as the Anti-Domestic Violence Law and the Charity Lawalso grant relevant NGOs opportunities to establish or grow their legal operations. Additionally, NGOs engaged in legal aid can now benefit from the new Legal Aid Law and the governments increased investment in their work.

These NGOs also generally find the judiciary more amenable to their demands, due largely to the recent judicial reforms. For instance, the case registration system has substantially decreased the chance that courts will reject NGOs cases during the pre-trial stage. The interviewed NGO lawyers also reported increasingly encountering judges who are more professional and respectful of their trial rights, thanks to the judicial personnel and responsibility reforms. In particular, those from environmental NGOs credited their vastly improved trial experiences to the many newly established environmental tribunals consisting of sympa",,"This study examines legal opportunity in China after the recent ??law-based governance?? reforms, including those that have professionalized the judiciary, established NGOs?? public interest standing, and expanded legal aid coverage.","Overall, the organizations included in this study demonstrated a strong inclination??though not always the capability??to adapt their legal practices to the new policy context.

"Taobao, Federalism, and the Emergence of Law, Chinese Style","Lizhi Liu, Barry R. Weingast","Lizhi Liu and Barry Weingast,  Taobao, Federalism, and the Emergence of Law, Chinese Style, 102 Minnesota Law Review, 1563, 1563-1590 (2018).",Minnesota Law Review,https://minnesotalawreview.org/,,"All developing countries face the problem of how to build the legal and institutional infrastructure (for example, securing property rights and the rule of law) necessary to support efficient markets. The historic path for the West involved parliaments and independent judiciaries that constrained the ruler. China??s path has differed considerably; from the beginning, it involved ??federalism, Chinese style.??

This Article explains how private actors are devising new institutional rules in China that hold the promise of creating what we call ??law, Chinese style.?? Taobao??China??s dominant online trading platform with over four hundred million users??is not simply an exchange platform, but one in the process of developing a modern legal system that enforces contracts, resolves disputes, and prevents fraud. We argue that the delegation implicit in law, Chinese style, parallels China??s earlier reforms during the 1980s and early 1990s that helped create federalism, Chinese style. In parallel with the earlier delegation, the new form of delegation also involves the delegation of authority and policy experimentation. Importantly, this approach to legal development is much less politically constraining on the central government than the Western approach.

Additionally, the emergence of Taobao??s national market","We asked two questions at the outset: (1) What is the scope of Taobaos law-creation? and (2) What effects is Taobao likely to have on federalism, Chinese style, and the common market?
Online market platforms, such as Taobao, appear to be changing the politics, economics, and legal infrastructure of China. We argued that Taobao has created far more than an exchange system; it has created a national market platform, including the market infrastructure necessary to sustain markets that the central government has found it difficult to provide. We called this phenomenon law, Chinese style.
Law, Chinese style, has emerged because the central government in China has effectively delegated the authority to develop this infrastructure to private parties. This delegation gives the central government several advantages: it provides an institutional basis for markets in a weak rule-of-law environment; it permits experimentation; and it also allows the central government to distance itself from any failures. We drew connections between these benefits and the advantages that characterize federalism, Chinese style??one that existed during the early reform efforts in the 1980s and early 1990s.
But, unlike federalism, Chinese style, this new system of creating a national market through private online platforms seems to tip the power balance towards the central government, rather than the other way around. On the one hand, Taobao holds the potential to circumvent internal trade barriers between provinces by fostering a national online market. While the rise of a national common market is likely to generate substantial economic growth, it has begun to challenge the regulatory power of local governments, as now many problems are no longer l",,"(1) What is the scope

Gantz,?The China Challenge: Excluding Mexican/chinese Evs from the United States, 40 American University International Law Review 73, 73-125 (2024).",American University International Law Review,https://digitalcommons.wcl.american.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2167&context=auilr,,"Concerns are growing both within the Biden Administration and in Congress over a potential flood of low-priced electric vehicles (EVs) from China, directly or, more likely, via third countries such as Mexico. BYD, a leading Chinese producer, has announced in spring 2024 that it intends to establish production facilities in Mexico soon, with an initial capacity of 150,000 cars annually, although in August it reportedly deferred those plans until after the U.S. presidential election.1?While BYD has contended that such production would be for the local Mexican market and for export to the more than fifty countries with which Mexico has free trade agreements, observers believe that the U.S. market is the real prize given its enormous size, with more than 15.5 million auto and light trucks sold in 2023. This article begins with a brief discussion of the current situation and remedial legal and practical measures likely to be applied to trade in passenger vehicles under the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) and relevant World Trade Organization (WTO) law. This is followed by the rationale for BYD and perhaps other Chinese auto producers to build factories in Mexico, the legal and practical options for BYD and other Chinese autos and SUVs assembled in Mexico to enter the U.S. market, and the trade remedy and national security actions available to the U.S. government to exclude those imports from entering the United States. Finally, this??*74?article examines the implications of the exclusion policies that appear likely to be followed by either Democratic or Republican administrations in the foreseeable future and offers some recommendations.","While there are few certainties and frequent surprises in U.S.-China trade relations, it is highly likely in my view that the U.S. government will soon extend its measures now applicable to direct imports under Section 301 to exclude Chinese-made indirect EV exports (principally expected from Mexico), from the U.S. auto market. Current concerns
over potential Chinese spying and data theft, along with those relating to protecting U.S. auto producers and their workers from possibly
ruinous competition, along with 2024 election politics, are
overwhelming.259 While the most direct route to this goal is probably through national security tools, a variety of trade and tariff tools are also available. In this respect, at least with Chinese-produced autos from Mexico, the United States has at least a year to choose one or more such actions and implement them in the normal manner.",,,"While there are few certainties and frequent surprises in U.S.-China trade relations, it is highly likely in my view that the U.S. government will soon extend its measures now applicable to direct imports under Section 301 to exclude Chinese-made indirect EV exports (principally

from Mexico, the United States has at least a year to choose one or
more such actions and implement them in the normal manner.260
The Presidents legal options are multiple and deserve to be
exercised wisely. A national security-based action may well be the
most effective and quickest approach, under the International
Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) and the National
Emergencies Act.261 The recently-used trade optionslike Section
301 of the 1976 Trade Actwhich has provided the United States with
at least a colorable basis for the penalty tariffs against China, and/or
Section 232 of the 1962 Trade Expansion Act, which is currently being
used to protect the U.S. domestic steel and aluminum industries
initially including from Mexico, are both options.
262 From an objective
point of view, Section 232 action seems far better justified for security
issues related to Chinese EVs than for protecting the U.S. steel
industry. These authorities are, for all practical purposes, judgmentproof given their foreign policy and national security justifications.
Multiple trade and tariff measures also exist. Among them, in my
view, a new antidumping and countervailing duty case self-initiated
by the Department of Commerce or brought by a group of U.S. auto
producers and workers, or a safeguards action, should be considered
as a plan of action. Full analysis of the existing data may well justify
findings of antidumping duties, countervailing duties and threat of
material injury, or threat of serious injury, the latter for safeguards.
The new Commerce regulations appear to permit Commerce to bring
a countervailing duty action against Chinese auto producers in Mexico
based on Chinese subsidization of those auto factories, under a threat of material injury to U.S. producers.263 This could presumably be taken
once BYD and/or other Chinese-owned producers begin auto
production in Mexico, presumably in 2025 or 2026, even if at that time
production is being allocated to the Mexican domestic market or third
country markets. Such an action, if successful, could preclude BYD
from even attempting to export its Mexican production to the United
States.
264 In the longer term, the United States government will have
to decide whether to permit Chinese auto and EV battery producers to
establish wholly-owned U.S. production facilities or, more likely, to
conclude joint ventures with U.S. enterprises. As noted earlier, this
seems to be the current approach in Europe, with Chinese plants being
established in Hungary, Spain, and perhaps elsewhere.265 In the past,
the United States has welcomed dozens of Japanese, German, and

We offer one of the first empirical inquiries into collegial panels in China. Specifically, when and why do judges engage in collegiality? How does the presiding judge compose a judicial panel? What is the panel effect? Based on 23,564 cases decided by a local court in Beijing, China, from 2015 to 2017, we build a network of judges' collegial behaviors and examine the judges' strategy for panel composition and its potential impact. We argue for an external mechanism of panel effects and provide a strategic account of coalition-building in a vulnerable environment. For mundane cases, Chinese judges tend to compose panels with junior judges. To some extent, such panels are their comfort zone. When facing complex cases, they tend to step out of their comfort zone and form panels with more capable judges. When doing so, they are also more inclined to make tough decisions, such as ruling against the government in administrative litigation cases and repeated players in civil cases, among others.

The crackdown is analyzed against the evolution of NGO governance strategy that has bifurcated into co-option and repression.

Underlying this escalation is the paradigm shift of governance strategy from ??maintaining stability?? to ??consolidating state security.?? Consequently, NGOs with evident pro-liberal inclination, mass mobilization capacities, and/or closer associations with ??hostile forces?? are most vulnerable to persecution.

The most common contractual elements violating mandatory provisions are illegal subjects of contracts (qualification) and illegal objects of contracts. The most common mandatory provisions subject to such violations are those provisions related to the right to use collective land in rural areas, lacking construction qualifications, lacking credit loan qualifications, unregistered real estate, the disposition of illegal construction. In practice, mandatory provisions are commonly misread and inconsistently determined, especially in contracts involving unauthorized disposition, transfer of unregistered real estate or houses built on rural homestead, contracts signed by parties without qualifications, contracts where one party involved in economic crimes. To improve the regime of contractual invalidation in China, we should legalize the reference of mandatory provisions, adopt a uniform criterion [in identifying mandatory provisions], narrow down the scope of application, and separate the civil and criminal trial practices.","The article concludes that the invalidation of illegal contracts in China occurs mainly due to violations of administrative and economic law, particularly land management, construction qualifications, loan restrictions, and real estate regulations.

Individuals should be able to attend a protest, event, or other lawful activity, without fear of being remotely identified and having that data aggregated with other personal data??a fear so strong that they may decide to stay home instead. They should feel comfortable that a level of obscurity will be built into technology used by companies or governments and that government officials will need probable cause before they can access this wealth of information.

The study of intra-party regulations turns this anthropomorphic image inside out, requiring scholars to regard the very notion of the Party and rule-based governance as ideologically and theoretically contentious matters. This article maps out??and criticizes??prominent approaches to the study of intra-party regulations and rule-based governance within the CCP. It is certainly possible to explain CCP intra-party regulations through external social theoretical perspectives, such as Ernst Fraenkel??s dual state model. However, such perspectives do not necessarily help one understand the CCP leaders?? and ideologues?? idiosyncratic approach to rule-based governance. Fraenkel??s dual state model, in particular, fails to fully describe the role of rule-based governance in the CCP??s governance project.","In conclusion, there is no self-evident way to describe the role of rule-based governance within the CCP. An attempt to explain the Party leadership??s approach through textually authentic formulations would appear unhelpful to a foreign audience; conversely, external theoretical explanations risk misrepresenting the Party??s idiosyncratic views. One might be tempted to argue that a balance between internal and external explanations could help outsiders understand intra-party regulations, but perhaps there is no such balance. The theoretical challenge stems from the Party??s ideological premises: the CCP is a political organization modeled after the same political organizations it seeks to overcome. In this process, the Party implements rule-transcending leadership through formal rules, until it does not. Ultimately, Marxism-Leninism??and any ideology??must be accepted as a matter of faith.",,"??How should scholars conceptualize CCP intra-party regulations and rule-based governance, given that existing approaches treat the Party as a black box or rely on external theoretical models like Fraenkel??s dual state???","The article argues that while external theoretical models such as Weberian rationalization or Fraenkel??s dual state provide some insight, they fail to capture the CCP??s idiosyncratic approach.

What Shapes Taiwan-related Legislation in U.S. Congress?,"Gang Lin, Wenxing Zhou, Weixu Wu","Gang Lin, Wenxing Zhou & Weixu Wu,?What Shapes Taiwan-related Legislation in U.S. Congress?, 30?Journal of Contemporary China?1?C21 (2021).",Journal of Contemporary China,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10670564.2021.1985840,https://doi.org/10.1080/10670564.2021.1985840,"Through a quantitative analysis of Taiwan?Crelated legislation between 1979 and 2020, the article finds that the degree of Taiwan?Crelated legislation is significantly correlated with the degree of tension in U.S.??China relations. While a deteriorating cross?CTaiwan Strait relationship is clearly associated with the increasing legislative activities for the sake of Taiwan, an improving relationship from the state of fair to good cannot guarantee a decrease of such activities. A unified government and the extent of the Taiwan lobby are both helpful in passing pro?CTaiwan acts but statistically insignificant. A content analysis of pro?CTaiwan bills approved by the Trump administration suggests a creeping movement to ??normalize?? U. S?CTaiwan relations with congressional activism and the less-restrained White House as a co?Cengine.","This article assumes that congressional promotion of Taiwan-related legislation from 1979 to 2020 is shaped by executivelegislative interactions, U.S.China relations, crossStrait ties, and the Taiwan lobby. Through a quantitative crosstabling analysis, it finds that a divided Congress is negatively correlated with Taiwanrelated legislative activities while a unified government is more productive in passing acts. The second hypothesis that the worse U.S.China relations, the higher degree of Taiwan-related legislation is verified statistically. The third hypothesis that the worse crossStrait relations, the higher degree of proTaiwan legislation is partly verified. While bad crossStrait relations tend to induce more Taiwan-related legislation, a fair relationship (neither too bad nor too good) between the two sides tends to discourage Taiwan-related legislation, suggesting that Congress would be quieter when crossStrait relations are in a fair period. The fourth hypothesis that more Taiwanese money for lobby tends to produce more Taiwan-related legislation cannot be 40See the statement at Press Release, Pelosi Statement on Passage of TAIPEI Act, Speaker.gov, March 4, 2020, accessed March 11, 2020, https://www.speaker.gov/newsroom/34201. 41Lindsay, Congress and Foreign Policy, p. 612. 42U.S. Department of State, A Free and Open IndoPacific: Advancing a Shared Vision (Washington, DC: Bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs, 2019), p. 8. 43National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020 (Washington, DC: U.S. Government Publishing Office, 2019); Congressional Record, 1 January 2020, accessed 26 March 2020, https://www.congress.gov/116/crec/2021/01/01/CREC-2021- 01-01-pt1-PgS8000.pdf. JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY CHINA 623 verified statistically because of incomplete dada. Data analysis from a macro perspective, however, could be supplemented by thick description for a better understanding of congressional promotion of Taiwan-related legislation. A study of Taiwanrelated legislation during the Trump administration confirms that the two of the four variables, U.S.China relations and crossStrait ties are more accountable than the other two. A weakly divided government in 2019 and 2020 cannot reduce congressional involvement in legislation concerning Taiwan. This does not suggest, however, that executivelegislative relations are irrelevant at all. It is simply because the simultaneous deterioration of U.S.China and crossStrait relations has reached a historical height that other factors fail to play an intervening role of neutralizing the effectiveness of these two powerful independent variables. Indeed, if the bipartisan consensus in the United States is to rebalance a rising China with more regional partners and to redefine crossStrait status quo beyond the constraint of oneChina policy, less leeway will be left for the interplay of executive and legislative branches within federal government of the United States. And if the bipartisan consensus between the ruling Democratic Progressive Party and the opposition Kuomintang in Taiwan is to rely on America to void off pressure from the mainland rather than seeking political conciliation with the latter, the cold confrontation across the Strait can only add new nutrition to more intimate connection between Washington and Taipei. The gradual normalization?? of U.S.?CTaiwan ties may even ironically reduce the relevance of the Taiwan lobby, since the bilateral ties have be",,"??Why does the U.S. Congress, despite executive branch opposition and constraints from China?CUS relations, continue to promote Taiwan-related legislation? What factors shape congressional activism on Taiwan policy???","The article finds that congressional activism on Taiwan legislation is shaped by strategic competition with China, Taiwan??s lobbying and domestic political pressures, and a bipartisan consensus framing Taiwan as a democratic partner.

This article examines the legal and political reasons behind the suspension, focusing on how China??s regulatory authorities shifted from a growth-first approach to one that emphasizes financial stability and risk prevention. The Ant case demonstrates the challenges of regulating large fintech companies whose business models straddle traditional banking and innovative digital platforms. By analyzing Ant Group??s structure, regulatory responses, and the broader political economy, this article shows that the suspension was not just about Ant itself, but also about reasserting Party-state control over the financial sector in the digital era.","In conclusion, the case of Ant??s IPO suspension is a good starting point to understand the underlying rationale for China??s financial regulation. The halting had its legal basis, economic reasons, and political motivation. The public??s emphasis on the story??s political aspects highlights the difficulties regulators face in a fast-growing market as they shift from a traditional entitybased regulatory framework to a more activity-oriented approach.

WHO WANTS A ROBO-LAWYER NOW?: ON AI CHATBOTS IN CHINA'S PUBLIC LEGAL SERVICES SECTOR,Xin Dai,"Xin Dai,?Who Wants a Robo-Lawyer Now?: On AI Chatbots in China??s Public Legal Services Sector, 26 Yale J.L. & Tech. 527 (2024).",Yale Journal of Law and Technology,https://yjolt.org/who-wants-robo-lawyer-now-ai-chatbots-chinas-public-legal-services-sector,,"The recent popularization of generative artificial intelligence (GAI) applications, such as ChatGPT and other large language model (LLM)-powered chatbots, has led many to expect transformative changes in legal practice. However, the actual use of LLM chatbots in the legal field has been limited. This Essay identifies China's public legal services (PLS) sector as a potential use case where AI chatbots may become widely and quickly adopted. China's political economy is generally conducive to such adoption, as the government must rely on technological solutions to fulfill its commitment to universal access to PLS. The Legal Tech industry is keen to find a practical use case for its LLM chatbots, which with proper development and fine-tuning could function adequately in meeting a significant popular demand for basic legal information. The use of AI chatbots in China's PLS sector could contribute not only to narrowing the gap in access to justice but also to strengthening the degree of legality in governance that the country has achieved through years of deliberate efforts. But such use could also raise a range of concerns, including loss of confidentiality, errors and inaccuracies, fraud and manipulation, and unequal service quality. On balance, however, AI chatbots *528 offer benefits in the PLS sector as a positive innovation, and the risks associated with their adoption appear manageable through pragmatic approaches.","Using an emerging use case from China, this Essay argues that near-term adoption of ??robo-lawyers,?? especially in their early form of AI chatbots, makes better sense in the public legal services context than in private practice. The chatbots will help close a part of the access-to-justice gap that is often overlooked. And the risks associated with their adoption appear manageable through pragmatic approaches. The favorable prospect for PLS chatbots surely has much to do with China??s state-dominated approach to constructing legality and the delivery of legal services. However, it is not unique to China that the adoption of novel technologies tends to advance along a path of least resistance. If AI chatbots may eventually proliferate in the law, there is also reason for us to prefer that they first be led into the public services scenario where, at least in the critical formative stage, there is less pressure on AI product developers to pursue quick profits at the expense of societal interests.",,"??What role do AI chatbots play in China??s public legal services sector, and what does their design and deployment reveal about the intersection of technology, law, and authoritarian governance???","AI chatbots enhance access to routine legal services and support the state??s efficiency goals, but they simultaneously constrain legal empowerment by steering citizens toward compliant, state-approved solutions.

We examined how the Chinese courts, faced with an explosive increase in workload caused by a legal reform in 2015, adjudicated expropriation disputes between the government and property rights holders. We used the variation of changes in the administrative case workload brought about by the 2015 reform across the courts to identify the causal effect of workload on the adjudication of expropriation cases. Employing a difference-in-differences method, we found an increased judicial workload to improve property rights holders?? chances of winning their case against the government. We explored t","The workload crisis is a major problem for courts around the world, with existing research documenting the effects of judicial overload on the delivery of justice, particularly in the domains of criminal justice and the resolution of civil and commercial disputes. This paper is the first of its kind to broaden the inquiry into a consideration of the impact of judicial workload on the delivery of justice within the realm of administrative litigation, which concerns judicial checks on the abuse of administrative power and the protection of individual rights against such abuse. Using hand-coded data from China, where the power of the courts to check authoritarian power is presumptively weak, we found that an increased judicial workload both increases property rights holders?? chances of winning their case again the government and prompts judges to support claims based on hard-edged rules, specifically administrative procedures, in deciding expropriation litigation. Judges?? incentives to use time-saving rules to adjudicate cases constrains judicial discretion, which is prone to arbitrary political influence (particularly from the local level) in authoritarian regimes.
