    "abstract": "Empirical studies of Chinese public opinion on capital punishment are very rare. Almost all past studies suffered from questionable survey designs and/or nonrepresentative/nonrandom sampling (e.g., student samples). In this study, to examine the breadth and the depth of public opinion on capital punishment, we turn to Chinese netizens’ opinions online on a particular capital case, the Lin Senhao poisoning case. Though our netizen sample has its own limitations, it is innovative and encompasses a broader group of representations than in past studies. Specifically, we address three questions: the diversity of netizens’ opinions, the rationales for netizens’ support for Lin’s death sentence, and netizens’ interactions. This study is the first to examine Chinese netizens’ opinions in a capital case in detail and to uncover potential complexities and nuances of such opinions.",
    "conclusion": "This study is the very first to examine netizens\u0019 opinions in depth in a famous capital case. Our analysis has focused on three issues: the diversity of netizen\u0019s opinions, the rationales for netizens\u0019 support for Lin\u0019s death sentence, and the interactions among netizens. Despite the innovative nature and strength of our data, there are some limitations to our methodology. First, our sample could have suffered from selection biases. For instance, people who do not have access to the internet due to the digital divide may have held different opinions on capital punishment. Second, our data lacked individual and personal background information. One particular concern is the identity of the netizens whose online comments we analyzed. In addition, it is unknown to what extent governmental censorship might have played a role (e.g., through hiring official trolls to \u001cclean\u001d the net). Third, our analysis in this study was limited to only one murder case, and netizens\u0019 opinions may be very different in other capital cases (e.g., corruption cases). Despite these limitations, a number of potential lessons can be drawn from netizens\u0019 discussions. First, though most netizens (by our count) supported Lin\u0019s death sentence, there is considerable variation in the breadth and the depth of netizens\u0019 comments. Strikingly, there was both support and opposition to almost every subject discussed by netizens, from support for and justification of Lin\u0019s death sentence, to sympathy for Lin, to views about Lin\u0019s and Huang\u0019s families, to views about Lin\u0019s defense, and to issues about judicial verdicts. For instance, netizens explicitly called for the abolition of China\u0019s death penalty in ninety-three comments, questioned the utility of capital punishment and the fairness of its use, and even argued that it is barbaric and a violation of human rights. Such bold voices and opposition show that the claim of \u001coverwhelming public support\u001d for the death penalty is likely misleading and fails to uncover the nuances of netizens\u0019 opinions. Second, despite the diversity in opinions, the influence of Chinese culture on the opinions of the majority of netizens is apparent. Concepts such as sharen changming and killing one to deter a hundred heavily influenced netizens’ support for Lin’s death sentence. It is also interesting to see how a traditional sense of justice and fairness turned around against the victim’s family when Huang’s father was pondering a suit for",

Second, though not a national representative sample, Chinese netizens serve as a better representation than samples in previous studies.

    "abstract": "The past decade has witnessed a persistent escalation of trade tensions between the United States (’U.S.’) and China in the solar photovoltaic (’PV’) sector. A recent move by the U.S. was to enact the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (’UFLPA’) to prevent goods, including PV products, produced in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (’XUAR’) of China from entering the U.S. market. Considering Xinjiang's large production capacity in polysilicon--a key raw material for the manufacturing of solar PV products--the enforcement of UFLPA i",
    "conclusion": "As the latest confrontation between the United States and China in the solar sector, the enactment of the UFLPA has exacerbated the already contentious relationship between the world's two largest economies. While the use of different forms of trade remedies by the United States against Chinese solar exports has persisted throughout the past decade, it remained possible for these products to enter the U.S. market as long as the tariffs were paid. However, enforcement of the UFLPA represented the beginning of a new era in which trade barriers faced by Chinese solar exporters may have effectively taken the most restrictive form, i.e., a total ban.147?As the Act currently stands, the legal hurdle for solar exporters within China and outside, as long as they have connections with the XUAR to overcome, is simply too daunting.

As long as the utilitarian approach of the \u0018Mass Line\u0019 is deployed as the guiding ideology and strategy in mobilizing this \u0018People\u0019s War,\u0019 these problems are inevitable as the natural consequence of the inherent dichotomy underpinning the \u0018Mass Line.\u0019 Further, alongside China\u0019s effective containment of the epidemic, this approach following the ’Mass Line’ seems to demonstrate its efficacy in strengthening authoritarian resilience through elevating the people’s support of the regime and reinforcing national identity, which are arguably critical cornerstones of China’s populist authoritarianism.

As the two largest fashion markets in the world, these countries both have controversies over the optimal IP protection against knockoffs. This study reveals that similar disputes have occurred in both countries because IP laws are not primarily designed for fast-changing fashion products. Although courts in both countries have handled identical legal issues, such as separability in copyright law, distinctiveness in trademark law, and patentability for designs, their approaches are quite different. While the U.S. doctrines, such as functionality in three-dimensional trademarks and trade dress protection for product packaging, are more developed in precedents, the Chinese doctrines, such as copyrightability in garment designs, are sometimes led by industrial policies. Since the Chinese government has been determined to develop its fashion industry, these two major economies will continue to compete to be not only the largest fashion economy around the globe but also the best legal environment to foster fashion creativity. The broader implication of this Article is that IP issues in the fashion industry have demonstrated how two distinct legal frameworks, characterized by comparable regulations yet varying social and economic standings, address analogous legal challenges.\"",
    "conclusion": "\"Despite the fashion industry\u0019s growing importance to the global economy, leadingfashion companies have been struggling to protect their designs against cheap knockoffs via existing IP regimes in both the United States and China, the two largest markets for the consumption of fashion products. These efforts have been largely in vain because none of the existing IP laws are specifically designed for this fast-changing industry. In both the United States and China, the designs in numerous fashion products fail the separability test in copyright law, distinctiveness requirement inDesign brands have encountered different challenges in these two major economies.First, the separability test in U.S. copyright law follows an established analytical framework that distinguishes useful articles from fine arts. Although China incorporates a similar concept of separability, its judiciaries have not yet developed consistent views on whether the applied arts should be treated differently from other copyrightable works. Second, the United States and China have rather different approaches to the distinctiveness requirement for non-traditional trademarks. Three- dimensional trademarks that consist of the shape or design of a product per se are presumed to be inherently indistinctive in the United States, whereas they could be inherently distinctive under certain exceptional circumstances in China. With regard to color trademarks, China adopts a more conservative approach than the United States does, as the former denies the registrability of single colors on absolute grounds, whereas the latter does not have a per se prohibition against the registration of a single color. Third, although both countries have a non-obviousness requirement for designpatent protection, the starting points are very different. The United Statesnon-obviousness in the perspective of analyzes a random designer of the same type of articlespresented, whereas China consults the perspective of an average consumer of the relevant product. Since an average consumer has a lower level of knowledge and pays less attention to the design details, the bar for non-obviousness in China is likely lower than that in the United States. Finally, recent practices in China suggest that the protection for product packaging or decoration ’with a certain influence’ under the AUCL has huge potent\"",

    "abstract": "Seeking and receiving an apology from the wrongdoer is a ubiqui- tous social phenomenon in Chinese culture and society. In recent years, litigation and apologies appear to be natural elements of contemporary life in China. Apologies as a legal remedy in Chinese laws and regula- tions have become prevalent for nearly four decades. In particular, in intellectual property law, the last thirty years have witnessed an explosion of apology cases. In such litigation, plaintiffs seek (and sometimes ob- tain) apologies from the defendants as a statutory remedy besides injunc- tion and damages. American businesses operating in China increasingly take to the Chinese courts to protect their intellectual property, and seek- ing apologies during litigation is deployed as a useful strategy to curb intellectual property thefts. \"This article explains the legal remedy of apologies popular in China but not commonly understood outside of the country. The essay discusses the evolution of Chinese apology laws and examines in depth apologies as a legal remedy in intellectual property laws and litigation. Based on more than a dozen judicial opinions, this essay considers the experiences of American corporations seeking apologies in Chinese courts and ana- lyzes the facts and issues of such litigation. Some preliminary assess- ments and recommendations are made following this examination with the hope of providing useful guidance.\"",
    "conclusion": "\"What happens in China has critical implications for the U.S. and the world. The apology laws and litigation profoundly affect businesses, per- sonal interactions, and other aspects of life in China. This raises immi- nent and continuous challenges to American businessmen and right-hold- ers doing business in China. The examination of American IP cases in China demonstrates that American right-holders are adapting to Chinese laws and customs, using apologies as a supplemental measure to protect IPRs in the country. There are at least two lessons that can be learned from past experiences. First, apologies offer an additional tool against intellectual property rights violators in China, and this remedy may be useful due to its effects in shaming and possible deterrence. Right-hold- ers should work with their local counsel to evaluate the strengths of their case carefully before initiating litigation and should request apologies only when there is a reasonable likelihood of the Court\u0019s approval. The Chinese law of apologies is broad and sketchy, leaving the courts with much discretion. Chinese courts seem more willing to approve apologies in certain copyright, trademark, and unfair competition disputes than in other types of litigation, for example, patent cases. The key to securing a successful apology determination depends on proof of reputational harm to the right-holder; the defendant\u0019s intent is also relevant. Second, making apologies properly and timely, especially when ordered to do so by the court, can repair or improve a business\u0019 image and public relations in society. China is an immensely competitive market, and businesses and consumers highly value personal dignity and pride. It is very com- mon for Chinese to go to court and seek apologies against wrongdoers, domestic and foreign alike, when people believe that their dignity or pride is injured. Increasingly, Chinese citizens file litigation and seek apolo- gies from American and other foreign businesses for intellectual property infringement. When the courts approve an apology measure against a foreign party, such a party should comply with the apology order in a timely and proper manner; otherwise, it will risk further reputational da\"",

There are now criminal law procedures that routinely use AI risk assessment tools-from bail hearings to criminal sentencing.8 Over the last few years, businesses have used AI for important test cases and scaled up operations.9 We have also experienced many changes since November 2022 with OpenAI's introduction of ChatGPT and the rollout of Generative AI and Large Language Models in our society. There is naturally much worry over *121 potential job losses,10 misinformation concerning public health and safety,11 interference in the political process,12 and the destruction of creative industries.13 It is no surprise then that enforceable rules concerning responsible use of AI continue to be of paramount importance. There are also the attendant worries over fairness and implicit bias.14 Bias may indeed be baked into the algorithms.15 AI has been found to be racist and discriminatory.16 We rightly ask whether machines can properly apply ethics.17 Other questions ponder the role of machines in developing intellectual property and issues of ownership and filing property interests.18 How can we prevent AI from *122 perpetuating wage inequality?19 Finally, what happens to the more than 300 million people who lose their jobs to AI in the coming years that Goldman Sachs estimates?20 The government of the United States (U.S.) has been slow to craft its own set of priorities, funding opportunities, and national security interests, let alone pass an actual piece of legislation that regulates the AI space. The U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) explored the potential and pitfalls of the regulation of AI in a report released in June 2021: AI is a transformative technology with applications in medicine, agriculture, manufacturing, transportation, defense, and many other areas. It also holds substantial promise for improving government operations. Federal guidance has focused on ensuring AI is responsible, equitable, traceable, reliable, and governable. Third-party assessments and audits are important to achieving these goals. However, AI systems pose unique challenges to such oversight because their inputs and operations are not always visible.21 There is no shortage of concerns about AI coming from different stakeholders. In March 2023, 1,000 tech leaders, researchers and others, including technology pioneers Elon Musk, Andrew Yang, and Steve Wozniak, released a signed letter that called for a moratorium on the development of the most powerful AI systems.22 Those 1,000 signatures were augmented by another 26,000 signatures within a few weeks.23 By April *123 2023, Geoffrey Hinton, the so-called Godfather of AI,24 resigned from Google, stating that \u001c[i]t is hard to see how you can prevent the bad actors using it for bad things.\u001d25 The growth in machine learning (ML) technologies is so fast paced that many industries, including music26 and film27 are continually being disrupted. On May 16, 2023, Sam Altman, CEO of Open AI, the company which developed and deployed ChatGPT to the public, appeared before the U.S. Senate Judiciary Subcommittee, asking for legislation to regulate the use of Artificial Intelligence.28 In his testimony before Congress, Altman stated: \u001cAs this technology advances, we understand that people are anxious about how it could change the way we live. We are too.\u001d29 By November 2023, Altman was fired, hired by OpenAI investor Microsoft, and then rehired by Open AI--all within five days.30 Much of this drama was reportedly related to concerns over AI in the future and the role the company should play in reducing harms.31 To date, the foundational normative work, that may lead to regulatory *124 responses, has fallen to voluntary guidelines given the paucity of formal, legislated, national, and supranational solutions. In the U.S., limited federal direction has been meted out in piecemeal fashion over the years,32 rather than as comprehensive, national legislation (with penalties for those who do not comply). With the U.S. government's laissez faire approach, patchwork of AI-related guidelines, and lack of legislative response, several states and municipalities33 have stepped into the breach. Governmental authorities in the People's Republic of China (China or PRC), on the other hand, have provided some cohesive guidelines for their respective scientists, investors, universities, and corporations to develop and deploy AI tools. Law and regulations are indeed required,34 not just unenforceable guidelines, frameworks, best practices, or self-regulating standards.35 There have been many calls around the world for governmental authorities to do something about AI creeping into our lives faster than we can navigate, let alone legislate against its dangers.36 For some countries, a sector-specific approach is being piloted.37 The premise is that AI in healthcare can be regulated differently than criminal justice matters. For other countries, a more comprehensive national policy38--not related to any specific sector--has been *125 the approach of choice. This Article explores the manner in which China and the U.S. are providing differing ethical guidelines and visions for the development and deployment of AI tools.39 This is occurring as the economies of China and the U.S. decouple.40 According to the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace: A partial \u001cdecoupling\u001d of U.S. and Chinese technology ecosystems is well underway. Beijing plays an active role in this process, as do other governments and private actors around the world. But the U.S. government has been a primary driver in recent years with its increased use of technology restrictions: export controls, divestment orders, licensing denials, visa bans, sanctions, tariffs, and the like. There is bipartisan support for at least some bolstering of U.S. tech controls, particularly for so-called strategic technologies, where Chinese advancement or influence could most threaten America's national security and economic interests.41 The U.S. enacted extensive export controls in October 2022 to keep semiconductor chips and chipmaking equipment out of China. China, in turn, has made it more difficult for U.S. firms to keep doing business in China.42 Bain & Company reported that \u001csome companies are closing research and development (R&D) labs and other operations there, and setting up partnerships to sell and distribute products developed and made outside of the country.\u001d43 Fears of forced technology transfer and the lack of control over intellectual property (IP) rights44 as well as a general uptick in Chinese bureaucracy for foreign investment make these changes necessary for U.S. *126 corporations.45 It is not just inside the U.S., but the campaign to restrict China's access to high tech components extends to U.S. trading partners.46 Following this Introduction, Part II of this Article provides a very basic explanation of Artificial Intelligence. Part III of this Article explores the ways in which China has set up its own ethical guidelines and varied rules for the future development and use of Artificial Intelligence. The authorities in China have taken some leading steps in reigning in the use of AI for adults and even more so for children.47 Part IV of this Article surveys the ways the U.S. government has regulated AI research and application. The U.S. has developed its own framework and blueprint for action, none of which has yet to be promulgated in legislation.48 These initiatives combine the ideas from industry, government agencies, research institutes, thinktanks, human rights watchdogs, and not-for-profit organizations.49 It is still a blueprint at the end of the day, aspirational rather than operational. This Article concludes in Part V by exploring the importance of national AI guidelines on the ethical use of AI, ML, and like technology. Because this Article is written in the context of the great decoupling between China and the U.S., the European Union (EU) approach is left for another time. Likewise, this Article does not examine in depth the many other countries which have engaged in developing their own national strategies, ethical guidelines, and laws.50 All these varying national developments beg the question whether an international agency should be founded to transnationally regulate AI research and implementation, an issue which is *127 also explored in Part V, the Conclusion, of this Article. The broad spectrum of differing approaches to regulation of the AI industry provides a great opportunity to apply the comparativist's lens.51 Professor John C. Reitz has written: Comparison starts by identifying the similarities and differences between legal systems or parts of legal systems under comparison. However, in performing the basic comparative job of identifying similarities and differences, one has to consider the scope of comparison: What is going to be compared with what? Here the comparatist comes face to face with the enigma of translation.52 Comparative law requires us to acknowledge the differences among legal systems.53 This inquiry goes beyond the classic ’beauty contest’ asking which system is better, a practice sometimes confined to the common law or civil law tradition.54 But, here the competing ’standard’ comes from the PRC,55 a jurisdiction that is based on scientific socialism and controlled by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).56 While this \"",
    "conclusion": "\"There is a fundamental problem with the guidelines from China and those from the U.S.: they are not law. Guidelines may serve as a convenient reference tool for governments looking to adopt AI technology and make some media headlines. They can help provide minimum standards for effective, responsible public procurement and use of AI--standards that can eventually be adopted by industry and, more importantly, be enshrined into law. Mark Chinen has written: There are good reasons why we would like to steer the development of AI applications, but it has been difficult to govern technology, particularly through harder forms of governance such as laws and regulations, even on the domestic level, let alone on the international plane.291 The U.S. and China are not the only two countries working on AI itself while also working on the regulation of Artificial Intelligence. There has been some highly successful collaboration on regulation coming out of the EU, which first commissioned a High-Level Expert Group on AI which released Guidelines for Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence in April 2019.292 The *157 European Parliament completed the first comprehensive legislation293 in the world concerning the development and use of AI, reaching a deal after three days of negotiations in Brussels on December 8, 2023.294 The legislation must still be voted upon by the European Parliament and the European Council, comprising representatives from the EU's twenty-seven Member States.295 It is drafted in the context of other digital policy priorities like cybersecurity, data privacy (the GDPR), and intellectual property protection, all which predate the EU's AI legislative project. Four years prior, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) announced its own set of five AI principles,296 utilizing a risk-based approach that could become a global benchmark. In 2020 the OECD's Global Partnership on AI and its AI Policy Observatory and Network of Experts on AI supported work among governments to support the development of AI for everyone.297 There is no shortage of examples of best practices among the developed, northern industrialized countries and some developing countries too. For example, Ireland has developed its own national strategy.298 Brazil's Congress has successfully passed a bill that creates a legal framework for AI use.299 So have the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia300 and Germany.301 Israel has also published a set *158 of ethical guidelines on Artificial Intelligence.302 There have been calls to incorporate the various principles and guidelines around the world into a comprehensive framework, understanding how to best integrate them.303 There is a practical reason for this: We operate in a global economy, and many AI projects have co-authors from the U.S. and China. There are Chinese data scientists working at U.S. academic institutions and corporate research laboratories.304 There may indeed be areas for common action from both the U.S. and China as: [I]nternational cooperation will increasingly take the form of issue-specific coalitions instead of truly international (or even regional) institutions. At times, Beijing and Washington might belong to some of the same clubs: for example, when it comes to nonproliferation of cyberweapons and certain kinds of artificial intelligence tools. In the long run, the digital superpowers could even have a shared interest in introducing and enforcing some international regulations to protect their own companies from being overtaxed by other countries.305 Collaboration among policymakers regarding AI regulation is also crucial.306 An index or framework could be developed to adequately translate the various competing guidelines. The Public Voice's Universal Guidelines for Artificial Intelligence is one such effort.307 So is the International Research Center for AI Ethics and Governance.308 The international community must determine how ethics guidelines can be interoperable. Lax AI--or a paucity of AI--standards should not be a competitive advantage for *159 countries seeking to attract the best talent. This should not be a race to the bottom.309 AI requires updates to our regulatory approach and upgrades to our risk architectures. It may be that the world requires an international agency to regulate AI development and deployment across boundaries. Gary Marcus at a TED conference in Vancouver, Canada, \u001ccalled for the establishment that there be an international institution to help govern A.I.'s development and use.\u001d310 Soon thereafter, in mid-May 2023, the Group of Seven (G7) economic group leaders agreed upon a \u001cHiroshima AI Process\u001d for the rest of the year to determine a mechanism by which AI is to be regulated.311 It was no surprise that in the summer of 2023, Ant?nio Guterres, the Secretary General of the United Nations (UN), offered to the international community a new UN agency dedicated to Artificial Intelligence.312 After all, \u001c[t]he United Nations views itself as playing an important role in the development and spread of emerging technologies.\u001d313 In November 2023, UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak brought together political leaders from 28 countries, under the sponsorship of the UN, for an AI Safety Summit.314 The summit, which featured a speech by U.S. Vice-President Kamala Harris, was intended to develop understanding about shared risks and opportunities of *160 AI315 as articulated in the \u001clandmark’ Bletchley Declaration.316 For U.K. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, [W]e agreed and published the first ever international statement about the nature of all those risks [concerning AI]. It was signed by every single nation represented at this summit covering all continents across the globe ... and including the US and China. Some said, we shouldn't even invite China ... others that we could never get an agreement with them. Both were wrong. A serious strategy for AI safety has to begin with engaging all the world's leading AI powers.317 But there is one caveat: ’Because AI is a multi-faceted capability, ’one-size-fits all’ regulation will over-regulate in some instances and und\"",

    "abstract": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) started in Wuhan, China, in late 2019, and after being utterly contagious in Asian countries, it rapidly spread to other countries. This disease caused governments worldwide to declare a public health crisis with severe measures taken to reduce the speed of the spread of the disease. This pandemic affected the lives of millions of people. Many citizens that lost their loved ones and jobs experienced a wide range of emotions, such as disbelief, shock, concerns about health, fear about food supplies, anxiety, and panic. All of the aforementioned phenomena led to the spread of racism and hate against Asians in western countries, especially in the United States. An analysis of official preliminary police data by the Center for the Study of Hate & Extremism at California State University shows that Anti-Asian hate crime in 16 of America's largest cities increased by 149% in 2020. In this study, we first chose a baseline of Americans' hate crimes against Asians on Twitter. Then we present an approach to balance the biased dataset and consequently improve the performance of tweet classification. We also have downloaded 10 million tweets through the Twitter API V-2. In this study, we have used a small portion of that, and we will use the entire dataset in the future study. In this article, three thousand tweets from our collected corpus are annotated by four annotators, including three Asian and one Asian-American. Using this data, we built predictive models of hate speech using various machine learning and deep learning methods. Our machine learning methods include Random Forest, K-nearest neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Naive Bayes. Our Deep Learning models include Basic Long-Term Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Bidirectional LSTM, Bidirectional LSTM with Drop out, Convolution, and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT). We also adjusted our dataset by filtering tweets that were ambiguous to the annotators based on low Fleiss Kappa agreement between annotators. Our final result showed that Logistic Regression achieved the best statistical machine learning performance with an F1 score of 0.72, while BERT achieved the best performance of the deep learning models, with an F1-Score of 0.85.",
    "conclusion": "\"\"We presented a study on recognizing hate speech toward Asians on the Twitter platform during COVID-19. Our contributions in this study are 1) We created a dataset consisting of 10 million tweets related to both COVID-19 and Asians. 2) We chose a baseline that is recent research similar to our topic. 3) We annotated 3,000 tweets by four Asian annotators, and 1,901 of them are the same as our previously annotated baseline. 4) We applied many machine learning and deep learning algorithms to the baseline to find the most accurate one. 5) We improved the performance of the classifiers by measuring the Fleiss Kappa agreement and balancing the dataset accordingly. 6) By filtering only 11.46% of the tweets with a low agreement between raters, we achieved an F1-Score of 0.85 using BERT. Therefore, we conclude that the classifier\u0019s performance in hate speech detection on Twitter is related to the agreement between annotators in labeling the data. In addition to the above experiment, we analyzed the features of tweets with high vs. low agreement to understand what kind of language is easily labeled and what kind is more ambiguous. To perform this task, we focus on the following tweets: Tweets labeled unanimously by all five annotators mean the agreement number is 1. \" Tweets with the lowest agreement. We used the threshold <= 0.3 to find these tweets.",

    "doi": "\"Bureaucrat-assisted contention in China is a type of collective action in which native-born local officials help socioeconomic elites launch or sustain popular action against outsider party sec- retaries by leaking information and sabotaging repression. Bureaucrats who assist local in- fluentials are neither elite allies nor institutional activists. Instead, they unleash or support collective action as a weapon in a power struggle against ambitious, heavy-handed or corrupt superiors. Unlike mass demonstrations that are mobilized as a bargaining chip, bureaucrat- assisted contention hinges on a partnership with local elites who have their own grievances and pursue their own goals. Because it combines bureaucratic politics and popular action, this type of contention can help us understand underexplored aspects of political opportunities, framing, and mobilizing structures. In particular, it shows how participants in contention sometimes span the state-society divide, and how collective action can influence (and be influenced by) power struggles within a government.\"",
    "abstract": "\"As the episodes discussed in this article have made clear, bureaucrat-assisted contention is difficult to pull off but often works. A coalition of convenience between native-born officials and local elites can generate enough pressure, when coupled with social mobilization, to get the better of a party secretary in a district, county, or even a province. Ironically, in a regime obsessed with \u001charmony\u001d (hexie) and stability, the disruptiveness that makes bureaucrat- assisted contention relatively uncommon can also make it effective, by showing officials at higher levels that something is seriously awry. This echoes the popular Chinese saying that \u001cbig disturbances lead to big solutions, small disturbances lead to small solutions, and no disturbance leads to no solution,\u001d (Cai 2010: 112)1 and suggests that although mobilizing the disaffected and making a commotion is risky in an authoritarian setting, drawing together a range of aggrieved parties, crossing the state-society border, and creating a spectacle (O\u0019Brien and Deng 2015: 470) can produce results. Bureaucrat-assisted contention is of course not always successful, and more research is needed to understand when and where it fails. Still, repeated recourse to this type of collective action can have lasting consequences by reconfiguring the relationship between secretaries, local officials, and socioeconomic elites. Once they force concessions or drive a secretary away, native-born bureaucrats are inclined to revive their cooperation with local influentials and launch contention again against a secretary\u0019s successor. Aware of what happened last time, new appointees are often more cautious and work harder to avoid simultaneously alienating local officials and elites. Over time, bureaucrat-assisted contention may not even need to be unleashed to have an effect. After more than a decade when maintaining stability has been the regime\u0019s top priority (Zhou and Yan 2014), a credible threat is often sufficient to check a secretary\u0019s power, ambitions or avarice.",

The study contends that traditional approaches outlined in both acts might be rendered outdated by emerging technology-based paradigms, particularly those embodied by existing multiple patterning and emerging particle accelerator technologies. By elucidating the transformative potential inherent in multiple patterning and particle acceleration together with the pioneering Steady-State Microbunching (SSMB) technologies, this analysis offers a discerning evaluation of the effectiveness of these chip laws in navigating the intricate dynamics of contemporary semiconductor fabrication. Two analytical frameworks, the disruptive innovation and path dependency theories, can offer valuable insight in examining the ramifications of the CHIPS Act. In conclusion, this article presents a fine-tuned viewpoint on the intersection of legislative endeavors and technological advancements in the semiconductor industry, thereby contributing to a deeper comprehension of the intricate interplay between policy frameworks and disruptive innovation.",

      "questions": "As the most carbon-intensive source of electricity, coal-fired power gener- ation is incompatible with international climate change mitigation efforts. The international community therefore agreed to transition away from coal to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 and remain within the temperature limits set under international law. However, phasing out existing coal power stations can conflict with international investment protection treaties. Recent arbitration claims against the United States, Canada, and European coun- tries show how foreign investors can challenge climate measures before international tribunals and threaten to paralyze the ambitious actions needed to address climate change. As a key financier of coal power infrastructure, China plays a crucial role in the global transition away from coal. Besides China's domestic reliance on coal, its companies have heavily invested in coal power overseas, particularly in Asia. Taking into account the threat of investment arbitration to climate reg- ulation, a crucial question therefore is whether foreign investors, for example from China, could slow down Asia's energy transition by challenging coal phase-out decisions before international arbitration?",

From 2020 to 2022, China widely used this tri- color tool to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. A commonly held assumption is that health QR codes have become obsolete in post-pandemic China. This study challenges such an assumption. It reveals their persistence and integration - through mobile apps and online platforms - beyond the COVID-19 public health emergency. A prolonged, expanded and normalized use of tools which were originally intended for contact tracing and pandemic surveillance raises critical legal and ethical concerns. Moreover, their functional transformation from epidemiological risk assessment tools to instruments of behavior modification and social governance heralds the emergence of a Data Leviathan. This transformation is underpinned by a duality of underlying political and commercial forces. These include 1) a structural enabler: a powerful alliance between political authorities and tech giants and 2) an ideological legitimizer: a commitment to collective security over individual autonomy. In contrast to the rights-centric approach embraced by Western democracies to regulate Al-driven biometric surveillance, China adopts a state-industry dominance model of governance.",

      "notes": "This article investigates the longevity of health QR codes, a digital instrument of pandemic surveillance, in post-COVID China. From 2020 to 2022, China widely used this tri- color tool to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. A commonly held assumption is that health QR codes have become obsolete in post-pandemic China. This study challenges such an assumption. It reveals their persistence and integration - through mobile apps and online platforms - beyond the COVID-19 public health emergency. A prolonged, expanded and normalized use of tools which were originally intended for contact tracing and pandemic surveillance raises critical legal and ethical concerns. Moreover, their functional transformation from epidemiological risk assessment tools to instruments of behavior modification and social governance heralds the emergence of a Data Leviathan. This transformation is underpinned by a duality of underlying political and commercial forces. These include 1) a structural enabler: a powerful alliance between political authorities and tech giants and 2) an ideological legitimizer: a commitment to collective security over individual autonomy. In contrast to the rights-centric approach embraced by Western democracies to regulate Al-driven biometric surveillance, China adopts a state-industry dominance model of governance.",

Central themes have included how the rollback of reproductive rights in the United States coincides with the judiciary's embrace of a broader \"jurisprudence of masculinity\" and the relationship between abortion restrictions and authoritarianism, as multiple countries have enacted restrictive measures while undergoing democratic backsliding. Yet, the scholarly conversation on abortion, democracy, and how courts reflect and entrench gender disparities entirely omits China-the largest authoritarian state and a country with a high incidence of abortion. This is largely unsurprising: the central challenge facing Chinese women has not been abortion access but state-mandated birth control and abortion. Almost no prior scholarship examines how Chinese courts adjudicate disputes over abortion. This lack of attention reflects the common understanding that courts play no role in regulating reproduction and that abortion remains unproblematic in China.

Whereas previous studies suggest the Chinese state effec- tively controls citizens' legal consciousness via propaganda, this analysis shows that the construction of legality by the Tianya public was not a top- down process, but a complex negotiation involving multiple parties. The Chinese state had to compete with lawyers and outspoken media to frame and interpret the scandal for the Tianya public and it was not always successful in doing so.

There are at least two explanations for this decline. First, in an authoritarian system, officials tend to exercise arbitrary power as a convenient means to not only exert political control but also address governance issues ?C?C?C they may benefit personally from such actions as well. Second, China's partial legal rationality has been mainly maintained through self-restraint by the Communist Party in the post-Mao era.

      "notes": "How should patent legislative power be allocated between central and local governments in order to construct a patent system conducive to promoting innovation? A comparative analysis of the models of the U.S. and China sheds light on this question. The early American states established their patent systems before the formation of the federal system, but the U.S. Constitution arrogated patent legislative power to the federal government, ending the era of decentralized patent systems. This centralized structure ensures uniformity in rules but might binder the system's adaptability and ability to experiment. In contrast, as China's patent system evolved, its patent legislative power spread from the central to the local governments. This shift led to the coexistence of dual-level patent legislative structure. Currently, twenty-nine out of thirty- one province-level authorities (93.5%) and twenty-one out of 323 city-level authorities with local Legislative power (6.5%) have established local patent laws. China's patent system is not entirely decentralized but rather, semi-decentralized, as the locales not only implement their local patent laws but also must enforce the central government's national patent laws. China's semi- decentralized patent legislation model embodies significant features of cooperative federalism, where the central and local governments share the national power to handle affairs and collaborate to address issues. Yet, the central government maintains a dominant position in this cooperative relationship, as a consequence of China's unitary state structure. Compared to the current centralized patent legislation model in the U.S., China's semi-decentralized patent legislation model has the advantage of making statutory law more adaptable to local specificities and promoting local competition and institutional innovation. However, it also faces challenges, such as increased costs due to inconsistency; efficiency decline stemming from rent-seeking behaviors; and the risk that local protectionism will create anti-competitive effects.",

The evolution of China's insolvency law and the pertinent judicial practice, especially its cross-border aspects, remains in infancy. This development underscores the significance of the 2021 Arrangement between Mainland China and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (\u001cHong Kong SAR\u001d) on cross-border insolvency cooperation (the \u001c2021 Arrangement\u001d). The Arrangement not only caters to the unique demands under the \u001cOne Country, Two Systems\u001d policy but also incorporates legal advancements and institutional features from the 1997 United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (\u001cUNCITRAL\u001d) Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency (\u001cMLCBI\u001d) and the 2015 Recast of European Union (\u001cEU\u001d) Regulation on Insolvency Proceedings. Therefore, the 2021 Arrangement signifies a crucial step forward in legal cooperation between Mainland China and Hong Kong SAR, highlighting the expanding legal interconnections between China, Hong Kong SAR, and the international community in the field of cross-border insolvency."

It is universally acknowledged that forging an effective and efficient partnership in this domain holds the key to nurturing a conducive business environment across both Mainland China and Hong Kong. The establishment of a formal mechanism for mutual recognition and assistance is critical in safeguarding legal interests and mitigating the uncertainties inherent in cross- border insolvency scenarios. With this objective, the 2021 Arrangement has been crafted to refine the cross-border insolvency proceedings, offering a structured approach to bolster cooperation between the two regions. Thus, the Arrangement marks a substantial advancement, playing a vital role in fortifying the market economy and propelling economic growth. Almost three years after the introduction of the 2021 Arrangement, its implementation has been less effective than anticipated, due to factors including its underutilization and communication gaps, among others. Given the closer business ties between Hong Kong and cities in mainland China, it remains to be seen whether the 2021 Arrangement can serve as a useful and practical solution to facilitate more efficient cross-border corporate restructuring actions and expand beyond the three pilot cities to other major cities in mainland China. Looking at successful international cooperation mechanisms, it's evident that there's a pressing need for both jurisdictions to embrace the UNCITRAL MLCBI, improve communication channels, and increase procedural transparency to facilitate more effective cross-border insolvency cooperation. The recommendations proposed in this article aim to overcome existing obstacles and improve the framework for cross- border insolvency cooperation between the two jurisdictions.\"",

From the exploration of the data localization restrictions, it is safe to conclude that sometimes countries have legitimate reasons to restrict data flow, especially for cross-border data transfer, even though data localization regulation itself is controversial. Therefore, the most acute issue for data localization is how authoritarian countries can be restrained from exploiting the data they collect. To address this issue, an intergovernmental organization should be established to monitor data usage among countries and provide a neutral platform to resolve disputes related to potential data exploitation.\"",

This study analyzes 650 Death Sentence Review Transcripts collected from China Judgments Online, aiming to decipher patterns and variations of death review decisions via descriptive facts and circumstances. We find that marital or domestic violence, offender's guilty conscience or forgiveness by victim's family, and insufficient heinousness underline the disapproval patterns. In contrast, large number of victims or victim deaths, use of weapon, brutal crime nature, being a ringleader in violent crimes, and significant drug weight in drug crimes describe the approval patterns with a general lack of recognition for mitigating circumstances. However, significant variations existed among approved cases, involving defendants who caused a single death for domestic or marital dispute, had no criminal record, committed a crime of passion, or carried low-purity drugs or acted as drug mules. These variations raise the question of whether the Supreme People's Court maintains a consistent standard following its own guidelines.",

The target of trust in the country is the Centre, which is ultimately the top leader. The critical issue domain for assessing the Centre's trustworthiness is policy implementation rather than policymaking. The Centre's trustworthiness has two dimensions: commitment to good governance and the capacity to discipline local officials. Observed trust in the central government indicates trust in the Centre's commitment, while observed trust in the local government reflects confidence in the Centre's capacity. A machine learning analysis of a national survey reveals how much conventional reading overestimates political trust. At first glance, 85 per cent of the respondents trust the central government. Upon further inspection, 18 per cent have total trust in the Centre, 34 per cent have partial trust and 33 per cent are sceptical.",
    "doi": "This paper proposes a new interpretation of survey findings of trust in government in China. The new measurement scheme treats the observed trust in the central government as an indicator of trust in the Centre\u0019s commitment and treats the observed trust in the local government as a reflection of confidence in the Centre\u0019s capacity. The study shows that the conventional reading of the national survey results considerably overestimates political trust in the authoritarian regime because it mistakes the observed trust in the central government for latent trust in the Centre. It is true that the vast majority of the population trust the central government; however, closer inspection shows that only about one-fifth of the population are confident about the Centre\u0019s commitment and capacity, one-third trust its commitment without the matching confidence about capacity, another third are sceptical about both, and nearly 15 per cent are distrustful of both. For scholars, the finding paves the way for exploring sources and implications of trust in the Centre. For policy analysts, the study suggests an innovative approach to obtaining a more accurate assessment of the authoritarian regime\u0019s \u001csoft power.\u001d The study highlights the importance of contextualization for optimizing conceptual equivalence, which is critical to avoid concept stretching in comparative political studies. Contextualizing a concept involves profiling its genetic structure in light of its specific context of origin. Applying a concept requires matching the genetic profile of a member of the conceptual family in a different setting with that of the prototype. In the comparative study of political trust, the prototype of trust in government can be traced back to John Locke’s social contract theory on the one hand and the practice of representative democracy and the rule of law on the other hand. In a democracy with the rule of law, the target of trust is an elected political institution that is simultaneously responsible for legislation and administration. The critical issue domain is law-making, and the distinction of commitment and capacity applies primarily to individual politicians. The study shows that political trust in China belongs to the family of political trust, but it has distinctive characteristics. National surveys ask people to assess the trustworthiness of the central government, but the invoked target of trust is the ruling party’s central leadership, which is ultimately its ’core leader.’ The central government is the organizational embodiment of the Centre, but the two are not identical. Since many people assume that the Centre is the master or owner of the country and therefore must be committed to good governance out of its own interest, the",

I recruited people who were couriers at the time of the interview or in the preceding 12 months. Table 1 shows the distribution of these couriers. At the beginning of the study, I attempted to diversify the interviewee pool according to location, given the possibility of variation across cities in terms of how platforms operate and how couriers work. When it became clear there was no significant difference across cities, I did most of my interviews in Chongqing, a municipality in southwest China, given my access to research support there. Interview questions included basic demographic information, employment history, work situation, interactions with other workers and supervisors, and experiences of strikes and protests. Many couriers shared their photos, videos, and social media communications with me, which helped me reconstruct collective action. Existing literature tends to neglect management\u0019s role (Veen et al. 2019), so I interviewed six people with management positions (four at service platforms, two at gig platforms). I also interviewed a system development engineer and an in-house lawyer to understand the technological and legal aspects of control and management. My assistants and I recorded and transcribed all 68 interviews. Second, I conducted online ethnography between 2018 and 2019. I joined four nationwide discussion boards used by food-delivery couriers in Baidu Tieba, one of the largest online communities in China. I also joined 10 social media groups formed by couriers. I examined the Weibo content of certain couriers who organized or participated in strikes or protests. Online ethnography enabled me to reach out to participants in collective action. I read discussions, listened to couriers\u0019 voice messages, and took notes and screenshots. Third, I conducted on-the-ground ethnography in Chongqing. I began to conduct online ethnography with couriers in Chongqing two months before GPCs there organized a series of strikes and protests in May 2018. As Figure 1 shows, Chongqing is one of the many cities in which platform couriers staged collective action. I went to Chongqing in June 2018 to conduct fieldwork. When I arrived in Chongqing, many GPCs still had fresh memories of the collective action. I stayed in a plaza where gig couriers hung out and joined their conversations. One service platform station allowed me to observe their couriers\u0019 and supervisors\u0019 routines, and a gig platform manager allowed me to visit his office. After I left Chongqing, I continued to observe the situation through follow-up interviews. I analyzed and collected interview and ethnographic data iteratively, moving between data and theories. Initially, I designed my interview questions based on literature on algorithmic control. After conducting the first 20 interviews and some online ethnography, I began to analyze data. As a number of the emerging themes and codes did not appear in the literature on algorithmic control, my preliminary empirical analysis prompted me to develop a broader theoretical framework. I then revised my interview protocols based on the newly included literature. I did supplemental interviews with the first 20 interviewees and then conducted 48 more interviews. Fourth, I compiled a dataset that contains 87 cases of strikes or protests organized by food-delivery couriers between 2017 and 2018 in China. I use the term \u001cstrike\u001d to mean a period of time during which people refuse to work; ’protest’ refers to the expression of opposition to something. All of the cases were both strikes and protests, as couriers not only refused to work but expressed their opposition to employers or platforms on banners or signs. I compiled the list from a professional news database (WiseNews), sear"

Each new interpretation inherits only part of its original meaning and incorporates newly introduced legal knowledge of legal equality and property ownership.

    "title": "If such environmental costs \",\"The polluter pays principle is explicitly detailed within Chinese environmental legislation, but this principle has been challenged in the context of bankruptcy law. 442 In practice, environmental costs have been transferred to society in bankruptcy proceedings, with many contaminated sites not having been cleaned up post-liquidation. 443 Some companies use bankruptcy regimes to escape their environmental responsibilities. 444 The enactment of EBL 2006 was a success in that it solved the problem of bankruptcy in China. 445 However, EBL 2006 has now become a haven for polluters insofar as environmental resources have become a somewhat free cost for companies under the bankruptcy framework in China. 446 From the perspective of the polluter pays principle, EBL 2006 has thus revealed a number of problems, such as a lack of environmental representation in bankruptcy proceedings, as well as environmental liabilities not being given priority in the winding up process. EBL 2006 should consider several changes to realize the internalization of environmental costs, such as giving priority to environmental liability in winding up and increasing the presence of environmental representatives in bankruptcy proceedings, which are recommendations on bankruptcy proceedings. 447 Meanwhile, the corporate entity post-liquidation is also an important way to internalize environmental costs. Therefore, the corporate veil should be lifted when there is sufficient evidence that a company’s shareholders have deliberately transferred property to avoid environmental liability, or that corporate accounts have been mixed with private accounts.\"",
    "authors": [],
    "journal": "Environmental claims are not provided for in this bankruptcy law. This increases the difficulty for environmental liabilities claims in bankruptcy cases. Furthermore, the EBL 2006 provides for a new order of distribution and confirms that priority claims are in Articles 43 and 113. However, environmental liability is not mentioned in the priority claims, which means it should be classified as general claims. Therefore, the environmental liability of bankrupt polluters has become an issue because the provisions on environmental liabilities in the EBL 2006 are blank. It results in the environmental liability of bankrupt polluters being ignored and transferred to public funds.",

For example, similar to the findings presented here, timothy Frye finds that business organizations in russia can help protect private property. 59 But the incorporation of the leaders of these groups into state institutions does not represent real political inclusion, rather, it is a form of co-optation."

This article examines the linkages between local governments' fiscal pressures and Chinese judges' decisions on financial sanctions. Based on data from criminal verdicts of official corruption and county government expenditures, this study finds that Chinese judges are more likely to impose financial penalties, especially fines, when judicial expenditures in a region are low. The conclusion remains unchanged after accounting for the endogeneity problem using the age of the county party secretary and the per capita financial expenditure lagged for one period as instrumental variables. Finally, the imprisonment penalty without increasing revenue is used to test the placebo, and no effect of fiscal pressure on the imprisonment penalty is found.",
    "abstract": "\"We organize data regarding the first trial of criminal cases on embezzlement and bribery crimes published by courts, matching them with the per capita financial expenditures of counties in China. Then, we empirically test the influence of fiscal pressure on judges’ financial penalty decisions. It is found that China’s courts exhibit great differences in their economic punishment of corrupt officials, which is related to the financial incentives caused by local fiscal pressure. When court funds in a region are lower, the judges there have stronger incentives to issue financial penalties to maximi\"court revenue, part of which comes from commissions from the local government according to the value of financial penalties judged and executed by each court. This phenomenon is more obvious for fines, which have a stronger ability to increase revenue for the court.",

The Ministry of Finance issued the \"Measures for the Administration of Fines and Confiscated Property\" to the Supreme People’s Court, the Supreme People’s Procuratorate, the Supervisory Commission, and the Department (Bureau) of Finance in various provinces and cities as well as other relevant departments on December 17th, 2020, emphasizing once again: \"e budget of fines and confiscations in the government budget revenue is a predictive index and is not issued as a revenue task index. The funds for criminal justice agencies to handle cases are guaranteed to be provided by the budget of the government at the corresponding level, and the budget arrangements for law enforcement agencies should not be linked to the fines and confiscation cases they handle in any year.\" This indicates that there is indeed a clear phenomenon in which the value of fines and confiscated property is taken as an evaluation index in judicial practice. Economic incentives and competition forge a close link between the behavior of judicial personnel and economic interests, leading them to selectively enforce the law, expand the scope of punishment for some crimes, and even identify one crime as another crime to increase the benefits derived from fines and confiscated property. This common judicial injustice is driven by the desire to obtain more income from financial penalties (Smercina et al., 2022). If the behavior of judicial personnel is not only linked to criminal activities but also affected by local finances and economic interests, then the justice offered by the courts will be in doubt, harming judicial credibility and therefore causing serious damage to social justice. Therefore, the legal system should be improved, the reform of the financial system should be accelerated, and the judicial reform process should be promoted. The joint results of these changes can achieve the goal of judicial fairness and justice.",

For example, the number of annual flood disasters worldwide rose from 1,389 to 3,254 between 2000 and 2019, accounting for 40% of the total number of *363 disasters and affecting 1.65 million people.7 The number of annual storm disasters rose from 1,457 to 2,034 in that time, accounting for 28% of the total number of disasters.8 In addition, the number of droughts, wildfires, extreme temperatures, and other natural disasters, such as earthquakes and tsunamis, have increased significantly.9",

    "doi": "Internet-based platforms are increasingly being used by governments around the world to facilitate public engagement with citizens. However, it remains an open question whether participation through these platforms can actually enable citizens to influence policies. We address this question by studying the patterns and consequences of online participation at a major electronic petition platform in China, a country with the world's largest Internet-using population. Content analysis of over 900,000 petitions reveals that a substantial share of them concern lower-class issues and are originated from less developed rural and suburban areas. Linking variations in petition volumes to an original data set of government policy priorities, we further show that online participation led governments to place greater emphasis on social welfare policies and to increase the coverage of a key low-income assistance program. These results underscore the potential of online participation as an important mechanism to improve the quality of governance.",
    "abstract": "\"As one of the most influential technological inventions of the 20th century, the Internet is seen by many as having the potential to give citizens a louder voice in the political process. However, concrete evidence on whether and how Internet-based participation can affect government policies remains limited to date. This article addresses this gap by presenting new evidence on the policy consequences of online participation from China's largest electronic petition platform. Contrary to the prevailing view that in developing countries the Internet is still a luxury technology enjoyed mainly by middle- and upper-class elites (Norris, 2001), our results suggest that when broadband infrastructure is made nearly universal, those from lower-class backgrounds will actively take advantage of new online channels to articulate their interests, and that their participation can lead local governments to place higher priority on social welfare issues in both rhetoric and actual policy implementation.",

The key focus is on nonstate actors operating independently from the formal establishment, including State-owned enterprises (SOEs), private sector firms, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), netizens, and media. These actors have a growing influence in shaping certain issues within the domestic process, leading to the formation of official preferences and policy outcomes.

    "conclusion": "Women are underrepresented in legislature almost worldwide, and China is no exception. Although the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) implemented its first gender quota in 1933, gender quotas and women's representation in China remain understudied. This study fills the literature gap by examining the subnational variation in gender quota implementation and women's representation in the county-level people's congresses (CPC). Through a comparison of four county-level units in Hunan and Hubei with similar socioeconomic features yet contrasting results in the numbers of female representatives elected in the 2016 CPC election, this study argues that women's access to CPCs is affected by the CCP's adoption and enforcement of grassroots quotas. The fieldwork shows that although all cases introduced a 30 per cent gender quota, only CPCs in Hunan province were able to meet the quota requirements. This was because the grassroots quota threshold was raised in Hunan and strictly enforced, partly as a response to the 2013 Hengyang vote-buying scandal. In contrast, CPCs in Hubei province nominated a large number of ’first hands’ (yibashou) candidates, very few of whom were women.",

During these field trips, I conducted semi-structured interviews with 55 representatives (31 female and 24 male) and 18 electoral officials (9 female and 9 male) working at the electoral district (xuanqu ’’), township and county levels. In addition, I also collected biographical information on the members of the four CPCs, which was published in pamphlets and kept only for CPC members. These data included representatives’ names, gender, occupation, party affiliation and educational background, and allowed me to analyse and compare the composition of the CPCs.",

Using survey data and in-depth case narratives of workplace disputes in China, we highlight three major findings. First, and uncontroversially, higher levels of formal education are associated with greater propensity to use legal institutions and to find them more effective. Second, informally acquired labor law knowledge can substitute for formal education in bringing people to the legal system and improving their legal experiences. The Chinese state's propagation of legal knowledge has had positive effects on citizens' legal mobilization. Finally, while education and legal knowledge are factors that push people toward the legal system, actual dispute experience leads people away from it, especially among disputants without effective legal representation. The article concludes that the Chinese state's encouragement of individualized legal mobilization produces contradictory outcomes’encouraging citizens to use formal legal institutions, imbuing them with new knowledge and rights awareness, but also breeding disdain for the law in",

Conventional wisdom holds that this strategy works because leaders can signal their benevolent intentions by removing corrupt officials. We argue that fighting against corruption can undermine regime support. By revealing scandals of corrupt officials, corruption investigations can alter citizens' beliefs about public officials and lead to disenchantment about political institutions. We test this argument by examining how China's current anti-corruption campaign has changed citizens' public support for the government and the Communist Party. We analyze the results of two original surveys conducted before and during the campaign, and employ a difference-in-differences strategy to show that corruption investigations, at the margin, suppress respondents' support for the central government and party. We also examine our respondents' prior and posterior beliefs, and the results support our updating mechanism.",

Many academics, and most journalists and activists, claim that these so-called 50c party posts vociferously argue for the government’s side in political and policy debates. As we show, this is also true of most posts openly accused on social media of being 50c. Yet almost no systematic empirical evidence exists for this claim or, more importantly, for the Chinese regime’s strategic objective in pursuing this activity. In the first large-scale empirical analysis of this operation, we show how to identify the secretive authors of these posts, the posts written by them, and their content. We estimate that the government fabricates and posts about 448 million social media comments a year. In contrast to prior claims, we show that the",
      "authorsDataDescription": "\"Academics and policymakers have long been focused on contested physical spaces, over which military wars have been or might be fought. For example, in the South China Sea, the Chinese regime is presently building artificial islands and the United States is conducting military exercises, both highly expensive shows of power. As important as this focus may be, we believe that scholars and policymakers should focus considerably more effort on the Chinese Internet and its information environment, which is a contested virtual space, one that may well be more important than many contested physical spaces. The relationship between the government and the people is defined in this space, and thus the world has a great interest in what goes on there. We believe that considerably more resources and research should be devoted to this area. Whatever the appropriate relationship between governments and their people, a reasonable position is that it be open and known. This is an area where academic researchers can help. By devoting great effort, they can open up this knowledge to the world. It is our hope that others follow up on the research reported here.",

These data was retrieved from the annual working reports of the provincial high courts. The total number of cases in each province was further divided by the total population of that province to measure court caseloads per 10,000 residents. This metric was used to roughly approximate the caseload of judges in different provinces. It is hypothesized that, the heavier the caseload, the less capable a court will be able to handle extra online publicity tasks (i.e. uploading its decisions to the SPC website), other things being equal. Admittedly, a better metric for caseload would be the average number of cases decided by each judge. But the data on the number of judges in each province are unavailable to the public. The above measurement is used to proxy for the actual caseload per judge.",

      "questions": "Around the world, governments are contemplating taking steps to reverse or mitigate the negative health and developmental effects that come from the increasing amount of time children are spending online and using screens. In 2023, the People's Republic of China (PRC) released a draft regulation restricting minors' screen time and internet use, which imposes a significant burden not only on children, but also on technology and internet companies that wish to continue operating in the country. However, the PRC's proposed minor mode regulation is neither an extreme departure from the types of restrictions neighboring countries in East Asia have imposed on children's screen time and internet use, nor its own previous regulations in this area. As such, the proposed regulation is unlikely to have violated a norm of customary international law against restricting children's internet use. Similarly, although international instruments like the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights guarantee a universal right of expression, which arguably includes an implied right to the internet, the proposed Chinese regulation is not likely to be deemed violative of either of these instruments because of ambiguities within them as to how states are meant to weigh children's rights against their protection. This conclusion is bolstered by the competing provisions of the Convention on the Rights of the Child about protecting children's fundamental rights while also ensuring their health and wellbeing. As such, the PRC's Draft Minor Mode Guidelines are likely to pass without facing significant legal challenges domestically or internationally.",
      "answers": "The health and development problems associated with children's excessive screen time and overuse of the internet are real,228 and governments have an affirmative duty to make an effort to protect children from these harms.229 The PRC's Draft Minor Mode Guidelines represent the latest development in a smattering of regulation in this area in the country over the past several years. And while minor mode appears to be a more facially restrictive method of reducing children's screen time than the previous Chinese regulations, it is well-founded in Chinese law. Furthermore, as displayed by the examples of South Korea, Japan, and Taiwan, China's neighbors have all attempted to resolve this issue in a number of ways which, despite differing slightly in substance, are not clearly less restrictive than the PRC's Draft Minor Mode Guidelines. Finally, while various rights of children are certainly implicated by all of the internet use restrictions mentioned in this Comment, current versions of relevant international instruments like the UDHR, the ICCPR, and the CRC all fail to provide a meaningful answer on how governments should balance children's fundamental human rights with protecting children from the real harm that internet overuse can cause to their physical, mental, and emotional wellbeing and development. While this Comment does not take a stance on how international institutions might accomplish this, or on whether they should do so at all, the analysis above depicts a significant gap in the *258 current framework of international human rights when it comes to children and competing interests. As governments continue to adopt new ways of approaching this issue, these ambiguities will continue to lead to confusion and a lack of uniform application of these treaties. The PRC's Draft Minor Mode Guidelines, even at the draft stage, rest on solid legal ground, both domestically and internationally, and they represent a regulatory trend that may continue across the globe as the internet continues to become more and more integral to daily life.230 If there is an international right to the internet embedded in the right to freedom of expression of either customary international law or in one of the international instruments analyzed above, an international body needs to make that clear or at the very least engage with how internet use restrictions for minors interact with such a right.",

    "conclusion": "Law and politics are closely related. The differences and changes in political factors have direct and profound impacts on law. As a fundamental political element, the political power structure basically has two typical forms, namely, a centralized system and a decentralized system. A centralized system means concentration of political power in both horizontal and vertical dimensions: horizontally, power is held in the hands of chief officials, while vertically, in the central government. By contrast, in a decentralized system, power is dispersed in a manner of pluralism in both dimensions. Through an empirical study of the history of early imperial law, this article compares the different facets of the judicial process that were under the influence of these two typical forms of power structure in ancient societies, tests the thesis in various forms, and thus explains the close relationship between law and politics. The Chinese Qin-Han and Roman Empires co-existed and developed in parallel at the two ends of the Eurasia continent, leaving remarkable legacies on human civilizations, including political and legal systems. Meanwhile, the Roman regime, especially during its imperial period, covers a vast territory comparable to that of early imperial China and shares similarities in terms of size, population, and level of economic development. Therefore, these two systems are ideally comparable in the analysis of causation between politics and law as it is easier to control variables by excluding potential influences from factors other than the political system, which is presumably a key variable in this study. Due to the differences in geographical environments, historical development, and political ideas, the political power structures in early imperial China and the Roman Republic (509 B.C.E.--27 B.C.E) can be taken as the representative institutions, respectively, of centralization and decentralization. The former regime consists of the Qin (221 B.C.E.--206 B.C.E.) and Han (202 B.C.E.--220 C.E.) dynasties. Meanwhile, the Roman *627 system in different periods had significantly more diverse characteristics: deviating from the Republican decentralized system, the Principate (27 B.C.E.--284 C.E.) appeared as a transitional form towards centralization, while the Dominate (284-565) turned to be a quasi-centralized system, which resembles that of early imperial China in many respects. These various patterns along the spectrum are used as ideal examples to verify the impact of political changes upon law and its enforcement. Different political power structures give rise to their corresponding styles of state actions and methods of allocating social resources and thus affect law and judicial practice.1 Under centralized systems such as the Qin-Han Chinese regimes, political power is in the hands of chief officials in a locality, controlled vertically by the central government under the absolutism of monarch. It leads to a strong and active state, a hierarchical control structure, and a mechanism where chief officials take full responsibility. This system generates a strong ability to mobilize and allocate resources, raises a large team of professional bureaucrats, and provides sufficient support for an active state-led judicial system, especially the significant costs required for criminal law enforcement and document-based superior review. By contrast, in a decentralized system, political power is dispersed in both horizontal and vertical dimensions; hence, the government is relatively weak and passive, and the capacity to mobilize resources is limited. Accordingly, governance is typically based on social participation and power balance, which gives rise to party-dominated adversarialism in judicial practice. Adopting the methodology of ideal-type analysis on law and politics,2 this article explores the key elements in the judicial process, including participants, procedural settings, and law application, in different political settings and analyzes the impact of different political power structures in these fields.",

Secondarily, we ask, why would the central government relinquish ?C or at least implicitly encourage ?C this authority?\"ut can we call this private system of rules ’law’?\"can\"",
    "abstract": "\"We provide tentative answers to our questions. We argue that the Chinese government has acquiesced in Taobao’s efforts; moreover, in subtle ways, it has begun actively collaborating with Taobao. E-Commerce platforms assume from the state the authority to enforce law within their domain; further, they also help the state to create formal law by experimenting with the nature and content of the legal rules appropriate for governing their platforms. In many ways, this development parallels China’s earlier reforms (1980s-early 1990s) that created federalism, Chinese style. As with the earlier reform effort, law, Chinese style also involves a combination of authority and policy experimentation (Montinola, Qian and Weingast 1995)\"To address this question, we draw on the ’what-is-law’? framework of Hadfield and Weingast (2013, 2014). They define a system of rules as law when it meets several criteria. We then show that Taobao’s system of rules has most of these characteristics and is therefore law.\"ed",

    "abstract": "\"Why would one person facilitate a community member's evasion of the law, even when there is nothing tangible in it for themselves? In this article, I draw on stories in Chinese villages under the one-child policy to suggest that the lack of moral legitimacy in a particular law motivates people to help others overcome legal or policy restrictions, especially when there are existing connections and trust among them. It reveals the influential impact of law's moral legitimacy on people's responses to legal evasion and the relational nature of legal consciousness. An individual's existing connections with and trust in those who evade the law often reinforce the sense of obligation to take matters into one's own hands to help right the wrong that has been done to them. Nevertheless, the consequences of participating in such collusion may reshape expectations and obligations within the community, pushing law-evading citizens to minimize risks for those who are willing to facilitate their evasion of the law. The fluid nature of interpersonal relationships in Chinese society also means that when things go wrong, supportive members may in turn use their insider information against the law-evading citizen to seek revenge or teach them a lesson.",

      "questions": "Judges rarely reveal their real reasoning in their opinions when they are influenced by factors that they know they should not consider. The natural next question is how, when a judge is improperly influenced, he or she reasons to justify a biased decision. In a set of experiments using incumbent Chinese judges, we first replicated the findings of previous studies that showed judges can be influenced by extra-legal factors. More importantly, we showed that judges may employ a range of legal techniques to rationalize decision biases: they interpret legal standards and legal concepts strategically, finesse the applicability of law, infer or deny causation and foreseeability, and draw different conclusions from facts. Our findings provide a more realistic understanding of how judges behave, and cast doubt on reasoned elaboration as a guarantee of judicial transparency and trustworthiness.",
      "answers": "Llewellyn (1931) critically argued that rule of law has never really existed because judges have always made law themselves, using rules to make their decisions seem plausible. Reasoned elaboration in the judicial decision-making process has been thought to constrain judicial arbitrariness and safeguard judicial transparency and trustworthiness (Fuller 1978; Hart & Sacks 1994; Waldron 2011). In this article, however, we find that judges can use reasons to incorporate their personal feelings. We provide evidence that they do so using a wide range of legal techniques and in many areas of the law: from interpreting legal standards to deciding applicability of law and from inferring causation to confirming mere facts. Our findings cast doubt on the effectiveness of reasoned elaboration as a means to ensure judicial transparency, and provide a more realistic understanding of how judges behave. How to reduce bias and constrain judicial discretionary power is a direction in which future research may proceed.",

The Code has three rules for liquidated damages. The first rule gives contracting parties the freedom to agree on this remedy and enjoy its convenience and clarity. It reduces the burden of proof, saves judicial resources, and respects freedom of contract. The second rule lets contracting parties request the courts to increase or reduce pre-set amounts that are disproportionate to the losses caused by breaches. This unique and flexible mechanism balances justice for both contracting sides, guarantees the validity of liquidated damages, advances respect for contractual freedom, makes this remedy more compensatory, and introduces benefits that other jurisdictions lack.",

    "conclusion": "Theory offers two diverging views on the effects of ex ante litigation risk on corporate liquidity proxied by cash holdings. Ex ante litigation risk, however, is difficult to measure. We test the liquidity effects of ex ante litigation risk by exploiting the phase-by-phase introduction of securities class actions (SCAs) in Korea. Following the increase in litigation risk, firms significantly increase their internal liquidity, especially those without directors' and officers' liability insurance and those that are financially constrained. The results hold robustly in difference-in-differences and regression discontinuity designs. We also find that the increase in ex ante SCA risk improves firms' stock market liquidity and valuation, especially for firms that do not carry liability insurance. Taken together, the results are consistent with the arguments that SCAs increase firms' liability risk and lower investors' risk.",

Higher litigation risk may also result in more costly debt financing. Both stock liquidity and firm valuation increase after the introduction of SCAs in firms that are not protected by D&O insurance. The evidence speaks to the net benefits of SCAs and the attenuating effects of D&O insurance. We also test the theoretically ambiguous effects of SCA risk on corporate investment and find that the net effect is statistically insignificant.",

Most foreign companies chose to establish Sino-foreign joint ventures consisting of two or more partners, usually a foreign company that was either U.S.-based or multinational, and a local Chinese company.7 For a U.S. company, a joint venture would be appealing because of the local partner's understanding of Chinese culture and its ability to navigate China's complex laws and politics.8 The local partner was usually a state-owned enterprise--a business entity owned by the state and under the control of the Communist Party.9 Further, most of China's industrial sectors were legally inaccessible to foreign companies in the absence of an established joint venture with a local partner.10 Thus, joint ventures with Chinese partners granted foreign companies the ability to do business in certain highly lucrative industries. As of the first quarter of 2022, there were approximately 124,600 Sino-foreign joint ventures in China. All prior laws governing joint ventures lapsed when the FIL and the Foreign Investment Law Implementing Regulations (FILIR) came into effect on January 1, 2020.12 All previously established joint ventures under the prior legal regime became subject to the FIL, P.R.C. Company Law and *4 related regulations.13 However, these joint ventures received a safe harbor period of five years by the end of which they were required to reorganize and register under the Company Law.14 The deadline marking the end of the five-year grace period is looming in the near future: December 31, 2024.15 The FIL Implementing Regulations indicate that registration is still possible beyond this date but missing the deadline would result in a host of serious legal and regulatory problems.16 For these reasons, all joint ventures organized under the previous legal regime are well-advised to file for corporate reorganization by the statutory deadline. A successful reorganization under the Company Law, however, involves a number of complex issues that could become a trap for the unwary or unsophisticated. This Article explains and analyzes these issues, as well as proposes several approaches to successfully comply with the registration requirements of the FIL in advance of the December 31st deadline.",
    "doi": "The fast-approaching deadline to reorganize and register existing joint ventures under the FIL and the Company Law requires U.S. companies in joint ventures to expeditiously organize their legal and regulatory affairs in compliance with the new statutory scheme. Missing the deadline would impose serious legal and regulatory obstacles that threaten the continued operation and viability of joint ventures established under the prior legal regime. While complying with registration requirements is not difficult, careful planning is required to avoid the pitfalls and traps that await the unwary. U.S. and other foreign companies doing business in China must comply with registration requirements in a timely manner to take advantage of the more favorable investment climate in China created by the historic FIL.",

    "abstract": "This article presents the findings of original research on ’judge quota’ reform. The reform's agenda was essentially aimed at professionalization: by edging out a given percentage of judges, only the better qualified judges would be re-appointed to create a more professionalized judiciary. A key component of the reform was to reduce the level and the intensity of both political and bureaucratic control over judges in adjudication and to decentralize judicial power to the rank-and-file judges, restoring individualized judging while enhancing judicial accountability. This article critically examines the potential and limits of the judge quota reform in the context of incremental legal reform in a party-state.",
    "conclusion": "For academic observers, the macro political context matters more than technical details; for the first generation of reformers on the ground, however, there is no other viable alternative to the incremental reform that has defined their careers. They made full use of the reform opportunities that the party-state offered to create a limited judicial space while realizing and accepting the political and institutional constraints. As the quota reform story testifies, the judiciary within an authoritarian political system can explore spaces for its own professionalization ?C judges can judge on their own most of the time and in most of the cases. In that process, the Party could be both a helping and a restraining hand, and the bureaucratic system, of which the court is an integral part, creates both positive and negative incentives for the reform. As soon as the reform project launched, it was subjected to processes of negotiation, com",

Among other objectives, the reforms aimed to strengthen the independence of judges, the financial autonomy of courts and the professionalism of adjudicators. Critics have questioned the success of the reforms, citing continued government intervention with adjudication and unchanged structural problems with courts. To date, there has been limited empirical literature focusing specifically on the judicial reform measures in the 2010s in China. This article provides a glimpse into what really was happening on the ground since the reforms through the lens of frontline judges. It concludes that the reforms have enhanced the financial autonomy of courts, the independence of individual adjudicators and the quality of judgments. 47% of the judges who responded to the survey agreed that the judicial reform was extremely effective. However, this study also reveals that the reforms failed to tackle deep-seated problems of the Chinese judiciary. Local government intervention with adjudication is still rampant. Courts continued to be severely understaffed. Judges are still ready to abridge procedures to arrive at an outcome that is consistent with the policy of the court leadership. While *88 the reform is not ’old wine in a new bottle’, there is still much room for improvement in the administration of justice in China.",

The overall objective of the Judicial Reform in the 2010s is the public feels that justice is done in every single court case. This can be translated into seven sub-objectives: (1) courts are more able to adjudicate cases independently than before; (2) the courts have more financial autonomy than before; (3) individual judges are able to adjudicate cases more independently than before; (4) implement the life responsibility system for the judges; (5) implement the judges quota system for the judges; (6) change the quantitative assessment of the judges; and (7) improve the quality of written judgments.",

As decision-making mechanisms for human-machine interaction, algorithms are not value-neutral and should be legally regulated. Algorithm disclosure, personal data empowerment, and anti-algorithmic discrimination are traditional regulatory methods relating to algorithms, but mechanically using these methods presents difficulties in feasibility and desirability. Algorithm disclosure faces difficulties such as technical infeasibility, meaningless disclosure, user gaming and intellectual property right infringement. And personal data empowerment faces difficulties such as personal difficulty in exercising data rights and excessive personal data empowerment, making it difficult for big data and algorithms to operate effectively. Anti-algorithmic discrimination faces difficulties such as non-machine algorithmic discrimination, impossible status neutrality, and difficult realization of social equality. Taking scenarios of algorithms lightly is the root cause of the traditional algorithm regulation path dilemma. Algorithms may differ in attributes due to specific algorithmic subjects, objects and domains involved. Therefore, algorithm regulation should be developed and employed based on a case-by-case approach to the development of accountable algorithms. Following these development principles, specific rules can be enacted to regulate algorithm disclosure, data empowerment, and anti-algorithmic discrimination.",

Compared to its pre-Covid self, the current Chinese Party-state apparatus can now track and govern individual activity with unprecedented precision and regularity. While some of these developments were emergency measures that were limited to the pandemic, many of them have become institutionally entrenched through generalized lawmaking and policymaking, permanently transforming the Chinese government’s relationship with its population. Most importantly, the Party-state delegated enormous administrative law enforcement and information collection powers to two levels of urban government ’ the ’subdistrict,’ and below it, the ’neighborhood community’ ’ that used to be institutionally marginalized.",

Many, perhaps most, of these countries pursued administrative expansion under the legal framework of emergency powers, which gave governments a temporary boost in control capacity, but also sent a clear signal that there would be, at some point, a reversion back to the institutional status quo. By 2022 or early 2023, administrative powers had indeed reverted back to its pre-pandemic status quo in most Western countries\u0014with mask mandates removed and declarations of emergency formally terminated. Even in countries like Japan, South Korea, or Singapore, where Covid control measures were significantly stricter than in Europe or North America, policies were unmistakably loosening by 2022, with few signs, if any, of a permanent expansion in administrative power.",

    "abstract": "Many governments have engaged in policy experimentation in various forms to resolve uncertainty and facilitate learning. However, little is understood about the characteristics of policy experimentation, and how the structure of experimentation may affect policy learning and policy outcomes. We aim to describe and understand China’s policy experimentation since 1980, among the largest and most systematic in recent history. We collect comprehensive data on policy experimentation conducted in China over the past four decades. We find three main results. First, more than 80% of the experiments exhibit positive sample selection in terms of a locality’s economic development, and much of this can be attributed",
    "conclusion": "\"In this project, we systematically examine China\u0019s policy experimentation over the past four decades, one of the largest undertakings of systematic policy learning in recent history. We present three sets of results. First, policy experimentation sites are substantially positively selected, and misaligned incentives across political hierarchies account for much of the observed positive selection. Second, experimental situation during policy experimentation is unrepresentative: local politicians exert strategic efforts and allocate more resources during experimentation that may exaggerate policy effectiveness. Third, the positive sample selection and unrepresentative experimental situation are not fully accounted for when the central government evaluates experimentation outcomes, which would bias policy learning and national policies originated from the experiments.",

For petitioners who seek support from mass allies, judges reduce the defendant’s sentence and grant probation, as pressure from below helps judges to partly resist administrative interferences. The criminal adjudication on petitioning is thus politicized, as political pressures from different sources covertly influence the litigation outcomes in conflicting manners.",

For petitioners who seek support from mass allies, in contrast, judges reduce the defendant’s excessive sentence of imprisonment and grant probation, as pressure from below outweighs pressure from above and helps judges to partly resist administrative interferences. The adjudication on petitioning is thus politicized, as political pressures from different sources covertly influence the litigation outcomes in conflicting manners.",

This study reveals a novel dynamic of state repression under authoritarian legality, namely, progressive legal repression. Instead of promptly issuing criminal proceedings to defuse threatening popular contention, the preferred state action is to induce aggrieved citizens to engage in available legal-bureaucratic procedures and then rely on bureaucratic practices to overcome political uncertainty and reduce the potential risks before officially resorting to criminal prosecution. This study further explores the conditions under which such progressive legal repression emerges and the mechanisms through which bureaucratic processing helps state agents to reduce risk.",

The fieldwork was conducted right after the official launch of the campaign in November 2013, which, as I discuss below, proved to be a crucial turning point as the rhetoric of legal governance promptly spread throughout the propaganda system from 2014 to 2015. I gained access to a county-level bureau for letters and visits (xinfangju ’’’, BLV hereafter) in W City through personal connections. I chose a county-level BLV to conduct fieldwork because it is where protest issues are commonly contested and resolved, whereas higher-level BLVs mainly return petition cases to county-level BLVs after receiving complaints. During the fieldwork, I was allowed to observe officials as they received complainants and handled petition cases. I observed approximately 60 cases of contention. The time-limited observation did not allow me to observe the entire trajectory of the government response in these cases, as the resolution of protest cases following bureaucratic procedures can often take years and sometimes even more than a decade. However, the different levels of bureaucratic processing in these cases gave me the opportunity to gain insights into how local officials understand the role of bureaucratic processing",

    "doi": "This article empirically examines the role of radical targets for grain yields in triggering China’s Great Famine (1959?C61), one of the largest man-made catastrophes in human history. Beginning in 1958, the Chinese central government assigned different targets for grain yields in most counties, based on their geographic location. All targets seemed unrealistically high. Using novel county-level data, combined with a spatial regression discontinuity strategy, we find evidence that these radical grain targets prompted excessive procurement and subsequent famine. Our estimates show that a one-standard deviation increase in grain yield targets led to an 18’ higher death rate in 1960. This article sheds new light on the consequences of target-setting in an authoritarian regime without considering local contexts. (JEL O21, N45, P26).",
    "abstract": "The unprecedented severity of China’s Great Famine has attracted a lot of academic exploration of its causes. This article contributes to this large literature by providing a missing link between the radical targets for grain yields implemented in the Great Leap Forward and the famine. In 1957, the Chinese central government adopted a national agricultural policy that set radical grain yield targets for most Chinese counties according to their geographic location. Using novel county-level data, combined with a SRD strategy, we find evidence that these radical targets caused excessive grain procurement and subsequent famine. Our estimates show that a one-standard-deviation increase in grain yield targets led to an 18’ higher death rate in 1960. Our study highlights the severe consequences of target-setting without considering local context, especially in an authoritarian regime characterized by a lack of accountability and monitoring of local officials.",

Regarding county-level population data, we managed to obtain a series of confidential yearbooks on population statistics in 20 provinces and constructed a new data set. For completeness, we also collected demographic data for several provinces from the gazetteers of these provinces and their corresponding prefectures and counties.13 In total, we obtained the county-level data on death rates for 22 provinces from 1956 to 1961.14 These 22 provinces covered 94.3% of the total population in 1957 and 96.2% of China’s total death rolls from 1958 to 1961.",

When local authorities have considerable say over work team members and bonds with protesters are strong, relational repression can help demobilize protesters and halt popular action. Even if relational repression does not end a protest entirely, it can limit its length and scope by reducing tension at times of high strain and providing a channel for negotiation. Often, however, as in a 2005 environmental protest in Zhejiang, insufficiently tight ties and limited concern about consequences creates a commitment deficit, partly because thought workers recognize their ineffectiveness with many protesters and partly because they anticipate little or no punishment for failing to demobilize anyone other than a close relative. The practice and effectiveness of relational, ’soft’ repression in China casts light on how social ties can demobilize as well as mobilize contention and ways in which state and social power can be combined to serve state ends.",

In this article, I examine the implementation of the One Child Policy in China, which has had an enormous impact on Chinese society and yet has received little attention from political scientists. I argue that the success or failure of the policy hinged on using frontline bureaucrats to infiltrate society. Important theories suggest that bureaucratic penetration may increase bureaucrats' responsiveness to citizens and decrease implementation of the law. Drawing on a unique dataset and natural experiment, I show the opposite to be true in China: a one standard deviation increase in bureaucratic penetration lowers over-quota births by 2 to 7 percentage points. There is suggestive evidence that bureaucrats leverage their social embeddedness to control society. The article shows how frontline bureaucrats beyond the police, military, or ruling party are key agents of repression and political control.",
      "answers": "\"A trope in some novels and movies about life under autocracy is that when bureaucrats become familiar with the people they govern, it makes them more sympathetic and more willing to defy the state to protect them. In the movie The Lives of Others, for example, a Stasi agent conducts intense surveillance of a suspected dissident writer in East Germany, and the time he spends spying on the writer and learning about his life gradually turns him into a secret ally of the dissident. In the conclusion of the movie, he risks his career and freedom to help the dissident escape the clutches of the Stasi. Social science theories about social embeddedness provide some support for the implication of this portrait of bureaucratic politics. Being more deeply embedded in local society might induce bureaucrats to be more responsive to the people they serve.",

However, less consideration has been paid to contemporary society and whether the public shares this theoretical approach. Using data from four waves of the International Social Survey Programme, examining public attitudes towards controlling habitual criminals and suspected terrorists across countries, I offer evidence for how preference towards authorities’ reactions (a proxy of fear of crime) affects preferences about judicial errors. My analysis shows that (i) the public supports the authorities in taking action against criminals and terrorists without a court order, though in different proportions depending on the specific means at hand; (ii) the apparent paradox of public support for the elegance of due process and fear of crime can be explained by the difficult reality of controlling criminals; (iii) absolute proponents consider type one errors to be worse and thus will not support any measures being taken, while absolute proponents consider type two errors to",

In this manuscript, I suggest we return to the crime control model and make the following contributions. First, I have aimed to explain the detriment to innocent people of overstating the severity of type one errors. The Blackstonian philosophy of criminal justice overstates the protection of the innocent, while experience tells us that the Blackstonian ratio is not useful in this context. We need to reflect not just on the hardship of exoneration, but why theorists\u0019 and the public\u0019s outrage have not reduced unnecessary incarceration, and why it is so hard for innocent people to challenge incorrect verdicts after trial. The more we speak about what is worse, the more difficult it becomes to save the innocent, while the less importance we place on sanctioning the guilty, the more danger there is to the community. This arises because, while a paradox that is different from our perceptions ’helps us make sense of the world, it can actively undermine our ability to understand it’.163",

The theoretical logic underpinning this article is the hypothesis that the fear of crime, as a reflection of the police or authorities’ reactions to potential crime or terrorist attacks, may indicate a public preference towards controlling crime or letting the guilty go free. It concerns not only the divergence in the criminal process between the crime control model and the due process model but also the divergence in public preference for either type one or type two errors. Although the bivariate or trivariate preference for judicial mistakes is not a statement about the 10:1 Blackstone ratio, the nature of making a choice about the worst type of mistake reflects t",

    "abstract": "A growing body of research suggests that authoritarian regimes are responsive to societal actors, but our understanding of the sources of authoritarian responsiveness remains limited because of the challenges of measurement and causal identification. By conducting an online field experiment among 2,103 Chinese counties, we examine factors that affect officials' incentives to respond to citizens in an authoritarian context. At baseline, we find that approximately one-third of county governments respond to citizen demands expressed online. Threats of collective action and threats of tattling to upper levels of government cause county governments to be considerably more responsive, whereas identifying as loyal, long-standing members of the Chinese Communist Party does not increase responsiveness. Moreover, we find that threats of collective action make local officials more publicly responsive. Together, these results demonstrate that top-down mechanisms of oversight as well as bottom-up societal pressures are possible sources of authoritarian responsiveness.",
    "conclusion": "\"Using an online field experiment to directly measure the responsiveness of subnational officials to citizen requests, we find that almost one-third of county governments in China are responsive to citizen requests related to social welfare. We find that threatening collective action causes a 10 percentage point increase in the overall response rate (or a 30% increase in the overall response rate), a 10 percentage point increase in the probability of providing a publicly viewable response, and a 6 percentage point increase in receiving direct, detailed responses. In contrast, while threatening to complain to upper levels of government causes a 8 percentage point increase in overall responsiveness, these threats of tattling have no detectable causal effect on publicly viewable responses. Finally, deferential claims of long-standing loyalty to the CCP do not on average cause increases in responsiveness.",

Based on in-depth interviews, it finds that despite the generally tightening political control over the social sector, the reforms have helped some law-related NGOs expand their litigation practice, social and legislative influence, and domestic funding sources. At the same time, these changes have had considerable cooptation effects by aligning these NGOs' interests with the state's and channeling their activities into state-sanctioned institutional processes. The findings suggest that states can effectively utilize a dualist strategy that combines restrictive and supportive approaches to public participation in the legal process. It thus sheds light on the progression of legality within various political and institutional contexts."

Part II of this Note will address the chief avenues that make such blatant theft possible, including (i) China's intrusion into U.S. academia, and (ii) the transparency required with state-run Chinese companies. Even with this acceleration of theft in recent years, however, there has been little to no development in the *195 ability to curtail it.7 So, Part III will explore solutions to address those gaps in policy concerning intellectual property enforcement and protection. This will take a two-pronged analysis: first, from an American domestic policy perspective-namely the implementation of trade restrictions and higher education reform-then, from an international law perspective, such as increasing the availability of remedies within the Chinese courts and utilizing European allies to apply pressure on infringing governments.",

    "url": "Concerns are growing both within the Biden Administration and in Congress over a potential flood of low-priced electric vehicles (EVs) from China, directly or, more likely, via third countries such as Mexico. BYD, a leading Chinese producer, has announced in spring 2024 that it intends to establish production facilities in Mexico soon, with an initial capacity of 150,000 cars annually, although in August it reportedly deferred those plans until after the U.S. presidential election.1?While BYD has contended that such production would be for the local Mexican market and for export to the more than fifty countries with which Mexico has free trade agreements, observers believe that the U.S. market is the real prize given its enormous size, with more than 15.5 million auto and light trucks sold in 2023. This article begins with a brief discussion of the current situation and remedial legal and practical measures likely to be applied to trade in passenger vehicles under the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) and relevant World Trade Organization (WTO) law. This is followed by the rationale for BYD and perhaps other Chinese auto producers to build factories in Mexico, the legal and practical options for BYD and other Chinese autos and SUVs assembled in Mexico to enter the U.S. market, and the trade remedy and national security actions available to the U.S. government to exclude those imports from entering the United States. Finally, this’*74?article examines the implications of the exclusion policies that appear likely to be followed by either Democratic or Republican administrations in the foreseeable future and offers some recommendations.",

    "conclusion": "Scholars of law, economics, and political science argue that collegiality matters. Considerable panel effects exist across jurisdictions, and judges compose panels strategically. In China, millions of cases are decided by collegial panels every year; however, little attention has been paid to the issue of collegiality. We offer one of the first empirical inquiries into collegial panels in China. Specifically, when and why do judges engage in collegiality? How does the presiding judge compose a judicial panel? What is the panel effect? Based on 23,564 cases decided by a local court in Beijing, China, from 2015 to 2017, we build a network of judges' collegial behaviors and examine the judges' strategy for panel composition and its potential impact. We argue for an external mechanism of panel effects and provide a strategic account of coalition-building in a vulnerable environment. For mundane cases, Chinese judges tend to compose panels with junior judges. To some extent, such panels are their comfort zone. When facing complex cases, they tend to step out of their comfort zone and form panels with more capable judges. When doing so, they are also more inclined to make tough decisions, such as ruling against the government in administrative litigation cases and repeated players in civil cases, among others. The study sheds light on judicial politics in China and has the potential to expand our understanding of collective judicial decision-making in transitional societies.",

    "url": "Empirical research indicates that, in the fields of invalidation of an illegal contract, the most commonly invalidated contracts [in China] are (housing) sales contracts, land usage rights (sell or transfer) contracts, construction contracts, (housing) rent contracts, land contracting contracts, and loan contracts. The most common contractual elements violating mandatory provisions are illegal subjects of contracts (qualification) and illegal objects of contracts. The most common mandatory provisions subject to such violations are those provisions related to the right to use collective land in rural areas, lacking construction qualifications, lacking credit loan qualifications, unregistered real estate, the disposition of illegal construction. In practice, mandatory provisions are commonly misread and inconsistently determined, especially in contracts involving unauthorized disposition, transfer of unregistered real estate or houses built on rural homestead, contracts signed by parties without qualifications, contracts where one party involved in economic crimes. To improve the regime of contractual invalidation in China, we should legalize the reference of mandatory provisions, adopt a uniform criterion [in identifying mandatory provisions], narrow down the scope of application, and separate the civil and criminal trial practices.",
    "doi": "The article concludes that the invalidation of illegal contracts in China occurs mainly due to violations of administrative and economic law, particularly land management, construction qualifications, loan restrictions, and real estate regulations. Courts often confuse administrative ’shall not’ clauses with validity requirements, leading to inconsistent judgments. Ye suggests narrowing the scope of mandatory provisions, applying consistent standards, avoiding excessive criminal law extension into civil disputes, and relying more on interest-balancing frameworks. The study emphasizes categorization plus balancing of interests as the legislative approach, but also highlights the need for empirical observation to support theoretical reforms",

Concern from Western governments and global human rights groups regarding China’s longstanding treatment of the Uyghur people has resulted in a freeze in negotiations for the EU-China Comprehensive Investment Agreement (CAI). This was also a result of China’s failure to ratify or implement relevant United Nations (U.N.) covenants and International Labour Organization (ILO) conventions and placing reservations or domestic legal barriers on them, as well as foreign accusations of forced labor.

The EU-China CAI remains frozen, and the paper suggests that only through stronger enforcement mechanisms, domestic legislation, and international cooperation can human rights protections be advanced.

As Beijing increasingly prioritizes national security interests, the Chinese government is enhancing its data security regulations to address national security concerns. The changes have led to greater scrutiny of cross-border data transfers, as well stricter regulations for multinational firms in China. This Article seeks to clarify the complexities of China’s data laws while emphasizing how companies should enhance their understanding of these regulatory nuances. Adopting a proactive stance and implementing rigorous compliance strategies are essential for multinational companies in China to protect their business interests within the context of this changing framework.",
    "doi": "As China continues to develop its data transfer and privacy laws, navigating this complex labyrinth of regulations remains a critical challenge for multinational corporations. The recent shifts in China’s legal framework, particularly in the realms of cybersecurity, data privacy, and cross-border data transfers, reflect the country’s increasing emphasis on national security affairs. Nevertheless, the recent release of the 2023 Draft Provisions also indicates a level of willingness to balance this emphasis with the practical considerations of spurring business activity. ’ The proactive adoption of rigorous compliance strategies, coupled with a keen understanding of the nuances of China’s legal environment, will be pivotal for businesses looking to thrive in this dynamic market. Staying informed and remaining agile in response to any future changes will be key for businesses to successfully scale the great cyberwall.",

    "abstract": "In 2019, New Zealand signed a Double Tax Agreement with China, with the purpose of alleviating the burden of double tax on cross-border transactions, as well as preventing international tax evasion and avoidance. The 2019 Double Tax Agreement replaces the 1986 version, which was one of China's first tax treaties signed after its entrance into the global market. At that time, China had a ’Great Wall’ protecting its tax base from other jurisdictions, which was evident in its DTAs. Between 1986 and 2019, China became one of the world's largest and most influential economies. A close examination of the 2019 Double Tax Agreement sheds light on the evolving relationship between New Zealand and its largest trading partner. In 2019, it became New Zealand who negotiated as if it had a ’Great Wall’ to protect and retain an adequate tax base. New Zealand can be seen to diverge further than expected from the OECD's Double Tax Agreement Mo",

Algorithmic decision-making can optimize litigation procedures and handle simple cases through procedural and formulaic calculations but cannot handle important complex cases; it can promote formal justice but cannot achieve substantive justice. Algorithms may be competent for many tasks in the courtroom but are not competent for judgment processes (96) such as guidelines for evidence standard, condition review, error correction, and judgment deviation prompts, processes in which algorithms can only be auxiliary tools for human decision-making. Humans are still the ones who make the critical and final calls. (97) Perhaps, with the development of AI technology, algorithms would undertake more work in decision-making, but it is still a judicial assistant and a working partner, not an independent judge. Even if the singularity of the strong AI age arrives, humans can still reposition themselves to embrace such a moment.",

It analyzes and compares the United States’ legal framework with the approaches employed by China and the European Union to construct an ideal framework for avoiding the destruction of our privacy and erosion of our civil liberties. It will examine all biometric data types and uses, with a focus on facial recognition and similar biometrics that can be used for remote identification.",
    "doi": "This century, tension between harnessing technology and protecting individual rights will continually recur. Americans should have the same minimum expectation of privacy whether they live in Illinois or New York, or whether they are walking down the street or in a store. Individuals should be able to attend a protest, event, or other lawful activity, without fear of being remotely identified and having that data aggregated with other personal data’a fear so strong that they may decide to stay home instead. They should feel comfortable that a level of obscurity will be built into technology used by companies or governments and that government officials will need probable cause before they can access this wealth of information. Congress should pass legislation built around protecting obscurity to avoid the possible chill on civil rights and the other myriad harms of biometric authentication, identification, characterization, and detection.",

The study of intra-party regulations turns this anthropomorphic image inside out, requiring scholars to regard the very notion of the Party and rule-based governance as ideologically and theoretically contentious matters. This article maps out’and criticizes’prominent approaches to the study of intra-party regulations and rule-based governance within the CCP. It is certainly possible to explain CCP intra-party regulations through external social theoretical perspectives, such as Ernst Fraenkel’s dual state model. However, such perspectives do not necessarily help one understand the CCP leaders’ and ideologues’ idiosyncratic approach to rule-based governance. Fraenkel’s dual state model, in particular, fails to fully describe the role of rule-based governance in the CCP’s governance project.",
      "notes": "In conclusion, there is no self-evident way to describe the role of rule-based governance within the CCP. An attempt to explain the Party leadership’s approach through textually authentic formulations would appear unhelpful to a foreign audience; conversely, external theoretical explanations risk misrepresenting the Party’s idiosyncratic views. One might be tempted to argue that a balance between internal and external explanations could help outsiders understand intra-party regulations, but perhaps there is no such balance. The theoretical challenge stems from the Party’s ideological premises: the CCP is a political organization modeled after the same political organizations it seeks to overcome. In this process, the Party implements rule-transcending leadership through formal rules, until it does not. Ultimately, Marxism-Leninism’and any ideology’must be accepted as a matter of faith.",

      "notes": "The policy dynamic described in the previous sections does not square well with the image of a smooth experimentation stage and an implementation stage beset with problems. The first 20 years of OGI experimentation were somewhat rocky mainly because local officials were worried about public scrutiny and potential embarrassment, and thus reluctant to cooperate with central experiments. And despite the misgivings of local cadres, the implementation era has proceeded surprisingly well after more experiments were conducted, higher levels accommodated local concerns, and cadres innovated and came to accept the Center’s clearer and less trying demands. Rather than an account of reliably successful and unsuccessful stages of the policy process, OGI is a story of ups and downs throughout, which can be traced to the central?Clocal divide, the nature of OGI, and its aim of promoting openness.

Specifically, it investigates whether exposure to information about the death penalty reduces support for capital punishment, and whether people with greater knowledge of the death penalty are less supportive of it. Results show that support for the death penalty in China remains high, but that knowledge and exposure to information significantly reduce such support. These findings suggest that even in China, where the state controls information about the death penalty, better-informed citizens are less punitive and more cautious about capital punishment. The study contributes to the global debate on the death penalty by providing rare empirical evidence from China.",

While a deteriorating cross?CTaiwan Strait relationship is clearly associated with the increasing legislative activities for the sake of Taiwan, an improving relationship from the state of fair to good cannot guarantee a decrease of such activities. A unified government and the extent of the Taiwan lobby are both helpful in passing pro?CTaiwan acts but statistically insignificant.

    "abstract": "This article assumes that congressional promotion of Taiwan-related legislation from 1979 to 2020 is shaped by executive\u0013legislative interactions, U.S.\u0013China relations, cross\u0013Strait ties, and the Taiwan lobby. Through a quantitative cross\u0013tabling analysis, it finds that a divided Congress is negatively correlated with Taiwan\u0013related legislative activities while a unified government is more productive in passing acts. The second hypothesis that the worse U.S.\u0013China relations, the higher degree of Taiwan-related legislation is verified statistically. The third hypothesis that the worse cross\u0013Strait relations, the higher degree of pro\u0013Taiwan legislation is partly verified. While bad cross\u0013Strait relations tend to induce more Taiwan-related legislation, a fair relationship (neither too bad nor too good) between the two sides tends to discourage Taiwan-related legislation, suggesting that Congress would be quieter when cross\u0013Strait relations are in a fair period. The fourth hypothesis that more Taiwanese money for lobby tends to produce more Taiwan-related legislation cannot be 40See the statement at Press Release, \u0018Pelosi Statement on Passage of TAIPEI Act,\u0019 Speaker.gov, March 4, 2020, accessed March 11, 2020, https://www.speaker.gov/newsroom/3420\u00131. 41Lindsay, \u0018Congress and Foreign Policy,\u0019 p. 612. 42U.S. Department of State, A Free and Open Indo\u0013Pacific: Advancing a Shared Vision (Washington, DC: Bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs, 2019), p. 8. 43National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020 (Washington, DC: U.S. Government Publishing Office, 2019); Congressional Record, 1 January 2020, accessed 26 March 2020, https://www.congress.gov/116/crec/2021/01/01/CREC-2021- 01-01-pt1-PgS8000.pdf. JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY CHINA 623 verified statistically because of incomplete dada. Data analysis from a macro perspective, however, could be supplemented by thick description for a better understanding of congressional promotion of Taiwan-related legislation. A study of Taiwan\u0013related legislation during the Trump administration confirms that the two of the four variables, U.S.\u0013China relations and cross\u0013Strait ties are more accountable than the other two. A weakly divided government in 2019 and 2020 cannot reduce congressional involvement in legislation concerning Taiwan. This does not suggest, however, that executive\u0013legislative relations are irrelevant at all. It is simply because the simultaneous deterioration of U.S.\u0013China and cross\u0013Strait relations has reached a historical height that other factors fail to play an intervening role of neutralizing the effectiveness of these two powerful independent variables. Indeed, if the bipartisan consensus in the United States is to rebalance a rising China with more regional partners and to redefine cross\u0013Strait status quo beyond the constraint of one\u0013China policy, less leeway will be left for the interplay of executive and legislative branches within federal government of the United States. And if the bipartisan consensus between the ruling Democratic Progressive Party and the opposition Kuomintang in Taiwan is to rely on America to void off pressure from the mainland rather than seeking political conciliation with the latter, the \u0018cold confrontation\u0019 across the Strait can only add new nutrition to more intimate connection between Washington and Taipei. The gradual \u0018normalization’ of U.S.?CTaiwan ties may even ironically reduce the relevance of the Taiwan lobby, since the bilateral ties have be",

      "answers": "The suspension of Ant Group’s IPO in November 2020 shocked investors and marked a turning point in China’s regulatory landscape. This article examines the legal and political reasons behind the suspension, focusing on how China’s regulatory authorities shifted from a growth-first approach to one that emphasizes financial stability and risk prevention. The Ant case demonstrates the challenges of regulating large fintech companies whose business models straddle traditional banking and innovative digital platforms. By analyzing Ant Group’s structure, regulatory responses, and the broader political economy, this article shows that the suspension was not just about Ant itself, but also about reasserting Party-state control over the financial sector in the digital era.",
      "notes": "In conclusion, the case of Ant’s IPO suspension is a good starting point to understand the underlying rationale for China’s financial regulation. The halting had its legal basis, economic reasons, and political motivation. The public’s emphasis on the story’s political aspects highlights the difficulties regulators face in a fast-growing market as they shift from a traditional entitybased regulatory framework to a more activity-oriented approach. While China’s financial regulatory landscape remains in flux, the case of Ant has provided valuable lessons for regulators and other FinTech companies and proclaimed an era of more stringent oversight after 2020.",

    "url": "The recent popularization of generative artificial intelligence (GAI) applications, such as ChatGPT and other large language model (LLM)-powered chatbots, has led many to expect transformative changes in legal practice. However, the actual use of LLM chatbots in the legal field has been limited. This Essay identifies China's public legal services (PLS) sector as a potential use case where AI chatbots may become widely and quickly adopted. China's political economy is generally conducive to such adoption, as the government must rely on technological solutions to fulfill its commitment to universal access to PLS. The Legal Tech industry is keen to find a practical use case for its LLM chatbots, which with proper development and fine-tuning could function adequately in meeting a significant popular demand for basic legal information. The use of AI chatbots in China's PLS sector could contribute not only to narrowing the gap in access to justice but also to strengthening the degree of legality in governance that the country has achieved through years of deliberate efforts. But such use could also raise a range of concerns, including loss of confidentiality, errors and inaccuracies, fraud and manipulation, and unequal service quality. On balance, however, AI chatbots *528 offer benefits in the PLS sector as a positive innovation, and the risks associated with their adoption appear manageable through pragmatic approaches.",
    "doi": "Using an emerging use case from China, this Essay argues that near-term adoption of ’robo-lawyers,’ especially in their early form of AI chatbots, makes better sense in the public legal services context than in private practice. The chatbots will help close a part of the access-to-justice gap that is often overlooked. And the risks associated with their adoption appear manageable through pragmatic approaches. The favorable prospect for PLS chatbots surely has much to do with China’s state-dominated approach to constructing legality and the delivery of legal services. However, it is not unique to China that the adoption of novel technologies tends to advance along a path of least resistance. If AI chatbots may eventually proliferate in the law, there is also reason for us to prefer that they first be led into the public services scenario where, at least in the critical formative stage, there is less pressure on AI product developers to pursue quick profits at the expense of societal interests.",

    "abstract": "This research offers a first-of-its-kind examination of the impact of judicial overload on administrative litigation. We examined how the Chinese courts, faced with an explosive increase in workload caused by a legal reform in 2015, adjudicated expropriation disputes between the government and property rights holders. We used the variation of changes in the administrative case workload brought about by the 2015 reform across the courts to identify the causal effect of workload on the adjudication of expropriation cases. Employing a difference-in-differences method, we found an increased judicial workload to improve property rights holders’ chances of winning their case against the government. We explored t",
    "conclusion": "The workload crisis is a major problem for courts around the world, with existing research documenting the effects of judicial overload on the delivery of justice, particularly in the domains of criminal justice and the resolution of civil and commercial disputes. This paper is the first of its kind to broaden the inquiry into a consideration of the impact of judicial workload on the delivery of justice within the realm of administrative litigation, which concerns judicial checks on the abuse of administrative power and the protection of individual rights against such abuse. Using hand-coded data from China, where the power of the courts to check authoritarian power is presumptively weak, we found that an increased judicial workload both increases property rights holders’ chances of winning their case again the government and prompts judges to support claims based on hard-edged rules, specifically administrative procedures, in deciding expropriation litigation. Judges’ incentives to use time-saving rules to adjudicate cases constrains judicial discretion, which is prone to arbitrary political influence (particularly from the local level) in authoritarian regimes. Our study also provides evidence on and refined analysis of the role of the courts in authoritarian regimes. This study demonstrates that legal doctrines matter (Lax 2011), even in an autho",
