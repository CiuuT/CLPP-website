    "abstract": "Empirical studies of Chinese public opinion on capital punishment are very rare. Almost all past studies suffered from questionable survey designs and/or nonrepresentative/nonrandom sampling (e.g., student samples). In this study, to examine the breadth and the depth of public opinion on capital punishment, we turn to Chinese netizens’ opinions online on a particular capital case, the Lin Senhao poisoning case. Though our netizen sample has its own limitations, it is innovative and encompasses a broader group of representations than in past studies. Specifically, we address three questions: the diversity of netizens’ opinions, the rationales for netizens’ support for Lin’s death sentence, and netizens’ interactions. This study is the first to examine Chinese netizens’ opinions in a capital case in detail and to uncover potential complexities and nuances of such opinions.",
    "conclusion": "This study is the very first to examine netizens’ opinions in depth in a famous capital case. Our analysis has focused on three issues: the diversity of netizen’s opinions, the rationales for netizens’ support for Lin’s death sentence, and the interactions among netizens. Despite the innovative nature and strength of our data, there are some limitations to our methodology. First, our sample could have suffered from selection biases. For instance, people who do not have access to the internet due to the digital divide may have held different opinions on capital punishment. Second, our data lacked individual and personal background information. One particular concern is the identity of the netizens whose online comments we analyzed. In addition, it is unknown to what extent governmental censorship might have played a role (e.g., through hiring official trolls to “clean” the net). Third, our analysis in this study was limited to only one murder case, and netizens’ opinions may be very different in other capital cases (e.g., corruption cases). Despite these limitations, a number of potential lessons can be drawn from netizens’ discussions. First, though most netizens (by our count) supported Lin’s death sentence, there is considerable variation in the breadth and the depth of netizens’ comments. Strikingly, there was both support and opposition to almost every subject discussed by netizens, from support for and justification of Lin’s death sentence, to sympathy for Lin, to views about Lin’s and Huang’s families, to views about Lin’s defense, and to issues about judicial verdicts. For instance, netizens explicitly called for the abolition of China’s death penalty in ninety-three comments, questioned the utility of capital punishment and the fairness of its use, and even argued that it is barbaric and a violation of human rights. Such bold voices and opposition show that the claim of “overwhelming public support” for the death penalty is likely misleading and fails to uncover the nuances of netizens’ opinions. Second, despite the diversity in opinions, the influence of Chinese culture on the opinions of the majority of netizens is apparent. Concepts such as sharen changming and killing one to deter a hundred heavily influenced netizens’ support for Lin’s death sentence. It is also interesting to see how a traditional sense of justice and fairness turned around against the victim’s family when Huang’s father was pondering a suit for civil compensation after Lin’s execution. To many netizens, going after the Lin family’s money was “greedy” and not “humane” once Lin had paid his debt with his own life. The influence of such traditional culture is what makes China “Chinese,” but may pose obstacles to further reforms of China’s use of capital punishment. For instance, many openly cast doubt on the prolonged but required judicial review process and called it “delaying and wasteful.” Their willingness to forgo legal procedures is troubling. Third, many netizens’ opinions also reflected their attitudes toward the existing system, from problems with the educational system (e.g., the failure of Lin’s education), to problems with the medical system (e.g., many questioned the failure of the hospital to save Huang’s life), to declining morality, to privileges enjoyed by government officials and the wealthy, and to the fairness of the judicial system. For instance, many of Lin’s supporters questioned his death sentence because they saw it as disproportionately harsh compared to other crimes/criminals (e.g., corrupt officials). Official corruption, in fact, is one of few issues that generated no disagreement among netizens, which may signal future difficulty in restricting the use of capital punishment in corruption crimes (see Miao, 2013). The lesson is that to change people’s opinions, more structural changes to the existing systems might be necessary. Lastly, an examination of netizens’ interactions shows both signs of irrationality (e.g., use of foul language and personal attacks) and rationality (e.g., putting oneself in others’ shoes, calling for rationality). In Furman v. Georgia, 408 U.S. 238 (1972), Justice Thurgood Marshall suggested that American citizens would be swayed by reasoned persuasion that included information about the practice of American capital punishment. Empirical tests of the Marshall hypothesis have primarily relied on a unidirectional intervention model in which information (intervention) is passed from the researcher to the subjects. In a rare effort, Sato (2014) turned to discussions among focus group participants and explored how public deliberation (two-way discussions) may change Japanese people’s support for capital punishment. Our study has examined netizens’ exchanges in a natural setting without any artificial intervention. The evidence shows that there was little compromise and adjustment, not to mention complete change, among emotionally charged netizens whose minds were often made up from the very beginning. Though there are obvious limitations with this form of online exchange (e.g., confusing or conflicting information, little guidance), the results raise the question of whether netizens’ exercise of freedom of speech online can bring positive changes to their opinions on capital punishment in China.",

      "authorsDataDescription": "Our methodology is innovative and unique in several respects. First, unlike quantitative survey research, our approach is largely qualitative in nature (i.e., content analysis of netizens’ comments), which allows us to examine Chinese netizens’ opinions in depth. As cases reported online are all real, concern about artificial manipulation in vignettes used in past studies is no longer an issue. Second, though not a national representative sample, Chinese netizens serve as a better representation than samples in previous studies. The China Internet Network Information Center (2017) reported that the total number of Chinese internet users (defined as “Chinese citizens who used the internet in the past six months” in the survey) had reached 751 million (54.3% of China’s total population) by June 2017, and 96.3% of them (i.e., 724 million) access the internet via their mobile phones. This high level of internet usage enabled us to use the opinions of interested netizens in our study. While geographical restrictions were often a major limitation in past studies, data in the Lin case covered all 31 provincial-level administrative units in mainland China and Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macau, led by Beijing and Shandong with 1,165 and 1,131 comments, respectively. Unlike survey respondents who might not have a real interest in death penalty issues, netizens in this study shared their opinions voluntarily, therefore reducing potential problems of some method- ological issues such as social desirability bias. Third, online discussion (i.e., exchanges of netizens’ comments) to some extent resembles the public deliberation discussed by Mai Sato (2014) in her study of Japanese people’s opinions on capital punishment. Such self-initi- ated interactions, missing from survey studies, allow us to examine the con- tent, form, and effect of such interactions.",

    "abstract": "The past decade has witnessed a persistent escalation of trade tensions between the United States (“U.S.”) and China in the solar photovoltaic (“PV”) sector. A recent move by the U.S. was to enact the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (“UFLPA”) to prevent goods, including PV products, produced in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (“XUAR”) of China from entering the U.S. market. Considering Xinjiang's large production capacity in polysilicon--a key raw material for the manufacturing of solar PV products--the enforcement of UFLPA is likely to profoundly implicate the U.S.-China trade relation in this area or even the global solar supply chain as a whole. While the UFLPA has a regulatory objective to promote respect for human rights and dignity, its impacts on international trade, especially solar products and their components, raise an important question with regard to the Act's compatibility with the U.S. trade obligations under the World Trade Organization (“WTO”) regime. This article provides one of the first critical and in-depth analyses of the interface between UFLPA and the multilateral trade rules, highlighting potential contraventions and proposing recommendations for the United States and China, respectively. Facing the imperative to facilitate the low-carbon energy transition, the world's two largest greenhouse gas emitters--China and the United States--need to find more common ground to accelerate renewable energy development.",
    "conclusion": "As the latest confrontation between the United States and China in the solar sector, the enactment of the UFLPA has exacerbated the already contentious relationship between the world's two largest economies. While the use of different forms of trade remedies by the United States against Chinese solar exports has persisted throughout the past decade, it remained possible for these products to enter the U.S. market as long as the tariffs were paid. However, enforcement of the UFLPA represented the beginning of a new era in which trade barriers faced by Chinese solar exporters may have effectively taken the most restrictive form, i.e., a total ban.147 As the Act currently stands, the legal hurdle for solar exporters within China and outside, as long as they have connections with the XUAR to overcome, is simply too daunting. Viewed from a broader and more systematic perspective, the enactment of the UFLPA signals the United States' willingness to adopt measures that *222 have profoundly disruptive implications for US-China trade flows, even potential economic “decoupling.”148",

    "abstract": "\"The ‘gridded management’ system is officially highlighted as playing a key role in China’s combat against COVID-19. Relying largely on the Maoist ideology of the ‘Mass Line,’ this system appears to effectively mobilize the people at the most grassroots level in the ‘war against COVID-19.’ This article, drawing upon a critical examination of this ‘People’s War’ from a Foucauldian governmentality perspective, discusses the violation of human rights and dignity and argues that the violations are inherent in the binary and utilitarian ideology of the ‘Mass Line’ deployed by the mobilizational party. As this methodology is embedded in China’s social management agenda raised by Xi Jinping in 2017, this article sheds crucial light on the ‘Chinese vision of human rights’ and China’s governance model today.\"",
    "conclusion": "\"Although the official media alleged that ‘the mobilization of the whole country to wage a people’s war against COVID-19 had fully demonstrated the Chinese human rights vision of “the people first,’” this article details that this ‘People’s War,’ drawing upon the utilitarian ideology of ‘Mass Line,’ entails rampant and serious harms to human rights and dignity-which suggests the untenable human rights vision of ‘the people first.’ Under the binary and utilitarian ideology, as even expressly acknowledged by the state-run media Xinhua that ‘the people of Wuhan have made a great sacrifice in exchange for the lives and health of more people’ the ‘people of Wuhan’ can, and have indeed been, replaced by other groups of people.Footnote89 In this sense, the fundamental rationale of resorting to the binary ‘Mass Line’ to mobilize the people’s devotion in the ‘People’s War’ echoes what Fang Fang described, ‘while the ash of time falls on each individual, a grain becomes a mountain.’ In the debate over whether autocracy excels democracy in containing the COVID-19 outbreak, some argue that the aggressive, extensive and effective implementation of the Draconian containment measures indicates the powerful ability of China’s political system to ‘rally, organize, mobilize, appeal, and act’ (despite the inevitable cover-up resulting from the very same political system) which, once again, shows evidence of a ‘highly resilient and powerful state.’Footnote90 Only some putting forward the ‘China model’ acknowledge the high economic cost and concern of sustainability entailed in this model.Footnote91 Nevertheless, this article shows that this assessment uses a utilitarian approach to assess another utilitarian approach by downplaying, if not completely overlooking, the violations of human rights and dignity as the real cost. This article further analyzes its problems with fueling discrimination and hatred in society and violating human rights and dignity. As long as the utilitarian approach of the ‘Mass Line’ is deployed as the guiding ideology and strategy in mobilizing this ‘People’s War,’ these problems are inevitable as the natural consequence of the inherent dichotomy underpinning the ‘Mass Line.’ Further, alongside China’s effective containment of the epidemic, this approach following the ‘Mass Line’ seems to demonstrate its efficacy in strengthening authoritarian resilience through elevating the people’s support of the regime and reinforcing national identity, which are arguably critical cornerstones of China’s populist authoritarianism. The ‘People’s War’ relies heavily on the people’s support and cooperation with the government. Although it is argued that regime support is contingent on a variety of factors, government performance and responsiveness are found salient-some late dataFootnote92 indicates that alongside the containment of the virus in China, the Chinese public’s support of both the central and local governments keeps growing from February to June 2020.Footnote93 Such data may be in tandem with the ideology underlying this ‘People’s War’-since the ‘Mass Line’ embeds ‘an implicit concept of social contract’ in which the response from the state would generate or boost populist support in return.Footnote94 This seems to suggest that this ‘from the masses and to the masses’ approach, creating a feedback loop, has largely activated community as an integral component of the governing process and strengthened ‘Party building’ at the most grassroots level. However, while attributing the effectiveness of the measures deployed by the Chinese authorities in containing the epidemic to public support and state capacity, one should not overlook the underlying factors fueling or leading to the support and capacity-it can be built upon the sacrifice of certain groups of people, as well as human rights and dignity. When the ‘war’ against COVID-19 continues and when China announced to make the measures preventing and containing the coronavirus the daily routine through, among others, extending the ‘health code’ to various other uses such as integrating it with local cadres’ political performance, individuals’ social credit scores, and food product employees’ health qualification, as well as through promoting the mass reporting system daily and in a wide range of settings including university campuses, the abuse and harm on human rights and dignity in the ‘People’s War’ as detailed in this article shed some critical light on the governance model and approach in China today, which is worthy of further study and observation.\"",

    "abstract": "\"This Article compares intellectual property (IP) protection for fashion designs in the United States and China. As the two largest fashion markets in the world, these countries both have controversies over the optimal IP protection against knockoffs. This study reveals that similar disputes have occurred in both countries because IP laws are not primarily designed for fast-changing fashion products. Although courts in both countries have handled identical legal issues, such as separability in copyright law, distinctiveness in trademark law, and patentability for designs, their approaches are quite different. While the U.S. doctrines, such as functionality in three-dimensional trademarks and trade dress protection for product packaging, are more developed in precedents, the Chinese doctrines, such as copyrightability in garment designs, are sometimes led by industrial policies. Since the Chinese government has been determined to develop its fashion industry, these two major economies will continue to compete to be not only the largest fashion economy around the globe but also the best legal environment to foster fashion creativity. The broader implication of this Article is that IP issues in the fashion industry have demonstrated how two distinct legal frameworks, characterized by comparable regulations yet varying social and economic standings, address analogous legal challenges.\"",
    "conclusion": "\"Despite the fashion industry’s growing importance to the global economy, leadingfashion companies have been struggling to protect their designs against cheap knockoffs via existing IP regimes in both the United States and China, the two largest markets for the consumption of fashion products. These efforts have been largely in vain because none of the existing IP laws are specifically designed for this fast-changing industry. In both the United States and China, the designs in numerous fashion products fail the separability test in copyright law, distinctiveness requirement inDesign brands have encountered different challenges in these two major economies.First, the separability test in U.S. copyright law follows an established analytical framework that distinguishes useful articles from fine arts. Although China incorporates a similar concept of separability, its judiciaries have not yet developed consistent views on whether the applied arts should be treated differently from other copyrightable works. Second, the United States and China have rather different approaches to the distinctiveness requirement for non-traditional trademarks. Three- dimensional trademarks that consist of the shape or design of a product per se are presumed to be inherently indistinctive in the United States, whereas they could be inherently distinctive under certain exceptional circumstances in China. With regard to color trademarks, China adopts a more conservative approach than the United States does, as the former denies the registrability of single colors on absolute grounds, whereas the latter does not have a per se prohibition against the registration of a single color. Third, although both countries have a non-obviousness requirement for designpatent protection, the starting points are very different. The United Statesnon-obviousness in the perspective of analyzes a random designer of the same type of articlespresented, whereas China consults the perspective of an average consumer of the relevant product. Since an average consumer has a lower level of knowledge and pays less attention to the design details, the bar for non-obviousness in China is likely lower than that in the United States. Finally, recent practices in China suggest that the protection for product packaging or decoration “with a certain influence” under the AUCL has huge potential to be deployed by fashion designers as a weapon against knockoffs. This provision resembles product packaging trade dress protection in the United States. Although, in its current form, the AUCL clause seems to be the most appropriate means of protection for fashion designers in China, its terms and wordings are ill-defined, and they have blurred the boundaries between the AUCL and trademarkor copyright laws.In addition, while U.S. laws are developed by precedents that provide fashiondesigners with more certainty, Chinese doctrines are sometimes led by industrial policies. Since the Chinese government has been determined to develop its fashion industry, Chinese courts have increasingly strengthened their protection of fashion designs by enforcing the AUCL and broadening the scope of non-traditional trademarks. Therefore, these two major economies will continue to compete to be not only the largest fashion economy but also the best legal environment to foster fashion creativity.\"",

    "abstract": "Seeking and receiving an apology from the wrongdoer is a ubiqui- tous social phenomenon in Chinese culture and society. In recent years, litigation and apologies appear to be natural elements of contemporary life in China. Apologies as a legal remedy in Chinese laws and regula- tions have become prevalent for nearly four decades. In particular, in intellectual property law, the last thirty years have witnessed an explosion of apology cases. In such litigation, plaintiffs seek (and sometimes ob- tain) apologies from the defendants as a statutory remedy besides injunc- tion and damages. American businesses operating in China increasingly take to the Chinese courts to protect their intellectual property, and seek- ing apologies during litigation is deployed as a useful strategy to curb intellectual property thefts. \"This article explains the legal remedy of apologies popular in China but not commonly understood outside of the country. The essay discusses the evolution of Chinese apology laws and examines in depth apologies as a legal remedy in intellectual property laws and litigation. Based on more than a dozen judicial opinions, this essay considers the experiences of American corporations seeking apologies in Chinese courts and ana- lyzes the facts and issues of such litigation. Some preliminary assess- ments and recommendations are made following this examination with the hope of providing useful guidance.\"",
    "conclusion": "\"What happens in China has critical implications for the U.S. and the world. The apology laws and litigation profoundly affect businesses, per- sonal interactions, and other aspects of life in China. This raises immi- nent and continuous challenges to American businessmen and right-hold- ers doing business in China. The examination of American IP cases in China demonstrates that American right-holders are adapting to Chinese laws and customs, using apologies as a supplemental measure to protect IPRs in the country. There are at least two lessons that can be learned from past experiences. First, apologies offer an additional tool against intellectual property rights violators in China, and this remedy may be useful due to its effects in shaming and possible deterrence. Right-hold- ers should work with their local counsel to evaluate the strengths of their case carefully before initiating litigation and should request apologies only when there is a reasonable likelihood of the Court’s approval. The Chinese law of apologies is broad and sketchy, leaving the courts with much discretion. Chinese courts seem more willing to approve apologies in certain copyright, trademark, and unfair competition disputes than in other types of litigation, for example, patent cases. The key to securing a successful apology determination depends on proof of reputational harm to the right-holder; the defendant’s intent is also relevant. Second, making apologies properly and timely, especially when ordered to do so by the court, can repair or improve a business’ image and public relations in society. China is an immensely competitive market, and businesses and consumers highly value personal dignity and pride. It is very com- mon for Chinese to go to court and seek apologies against wrongdoers, domestic and foreign alike, when people believe that their dignity or pride is injured. Increasingly, Chinese citizens file litigation and seek apolo- gies from American and other foreign businesses for intellectual property infringement. When the courts approve an apology measure against a foreign party, such a party should comply with the apology order in a timely and proper manner; otherwise, it will risk further reputational damage and public embarrassment.\"",

      "authorsDataDescription": "To secure an apology, the plaintiff must ensure the existence of the following conditions. First, the case is supported by a relevant statute (e.g., the Copyright Law, and the Civil Code) that spells out apologies as a measure of civil liability. In this regard, copyright infringement claims, which may involve illegal copying, publishing, disseminating, and/or distributing of writings, im- ages, music, movies, video games, and computer software, are the strong- est candidates for an apology measure. Second, because there are no apology measures spelled out in the Trademark Law or the Anti-Unfair Competition Law, an apology request in trademark infringement and un- fair competition cases should be based on the Civil Code’s “personality rights,” under which the reputational harm suffered must be established to make an apology relief approvable. Third, for the plaintiff to persuade the court to issue apology relief, sometimes it may be necessary to prove the wrongdoer’s knowledge and intention (or malice), which is especially true in trademark and unfair competition cases. Finally, the geographical scope of a violation may be relevant to the kind of media used to deliver an apology.",

    "abstract": "(This article starts with intro) \"For years, we have heard warnings about the coming era of Artificial Intelligence (AI).1 We have read about alarming dystopian concepts like slaughterbots2 and gasped at the real-world consequences of Stanford University's prediction software concerning sexual orientation.3 AI is *120 increasingly used in decision-making for the allocation of education, employment,4 healthcare,5 justice,6 finance,7 and other private and public services. There are now criminal law procedures that routinely use AI risk assessment tools-from bail hearings to criminal sentencing.8 Over the last few years, businesses have used AI for important test cases and scaled up operations.9 We have also experienced many changes since November 2022 with OpenAI's introduction of ChatGPT and the rollout of Generative AI and Large Language Models in our society. There is naturally much worry over *121 potential job losses,10 misinformation concerning public health and safety,11 interference in the political process,12 and the destruction of creative industries.13 It is no surprise then that enforceable rules concerning responsible use of AI continue to be of paramount importance. There are also the attendant worries over fairness and implicit bias.14 Bias may indeed be baked into the algorithms.15 AI has been found to be racist and discriminatory.16 We rightly ask whether machines can properly apply ethics.17 Other questions ponder the role of machines in developing intellectual property and issues of ownership and filing property interests.18 How can we prevent AI from *122 perpetuating wage inequality?19 Finally, what happens to the more than 300 million people who lose their jobs to AI in the coming years that Goldman Sachs estimates?20 The government of the United States (U.S.) has been slow to craft its own set of priorities, funding opportunities, and national security interests, let alone pass an actual piece of legislation that regulates the AI space. The U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) explored the potential and pitfalls of the regulation of AI in a report released in June 2021: AI is a transformative technology with applications in medicine, agriculture, manufacturing, transportation, defense, and many other areas. It also holds substantial promise for improving government operations. Federal guidance has focused on ensuring AI is responsible, equitable, traceable, reliable, and governable. Third-party assessments and audits are important to achieving these goals. However, AI systems pose unique challenges to such oversight because their inputs and operations are not always visible.21 There is no shortage of concerns about AI coming from different stakeholders. In March 2023, 1,000 tech leaders, researchers and others, including technology pioneers Elon Musk, Andrew Yang, and Steve Wozniak, released a signed letter that called for a moratorium on the development of the most powerful AI systems.22 Those 1,000 signatures were augmented by another 26,000 signatures within a few weeks.23 By April *123 2023, Geoffrey Hinton, the so-called Godfather of AI,24 resigned from Google, stating that “[i]t is hard to see how you can prevent the bad actors using it for bad things.”25 The growth in machine learning (ML) technologies is so fast paced that many industries, including music26 and film27 are continually being disrupted. On May 16, 2023, Sam Altman, CEO of Open AI, the company which developed and deployed ChatGPT to the public, appeared before the U.S. Senate Judiciary Subcommittee, asking for legislation to regulate the use of Artificial Intelligence.28 In his testimony before Congress, Altman stated: “As this technology advances, we understand that people are anxious about how it could change the way we live. We are too.”29 By November 2023, Altman was fired, hired by OpenAI investor Microsoft, and then rehired by Open AI--all within five days.30 Much of this drama was reportedly related to concerns over AI in the future and the role the company should play in reducing harms.31 To date, the foundational normative work, that may lead to regulatory *124 responses, has fallen to voluntary guidelines given the paucity of formal, legislated, national, and supranational solutions. In the U.S., limited federal direction has been meted out in piecemeal fashion over the years,32 rather than as comprehensive, national legislation (with penalties for those who do not comply). With the U.S. government's laissez faire approach, patchwork of AI-related guidelines, and lack of legislative response, several states and municipalities33 have stepped into the breach. Governmental authorities in the People's Republic of China (China or PRC), on the other hand, have provided some cohesive guidelines for their respective scientists, investors, universities, and corporations to develop and deploy AI tools. Law and regulations are indeed required,34 not just unenforceable guidelines, frameworks, best practices, or self-regulating standards.35 There have been many calls around the world for governmental authorities to do something about AI creeping into our lives faster than we can navigate, let alone legislate against its dangers.36 For some countries, a sector-specific approach is being piloted.37 The premise is that AI in healthcare can be regulated differently than criminal justice matters. For other countries, a more comprehensive national policy38--not related to any specific sector--has been *125 the approach of choice. This Article explores the manner in which China and the U.S. are providing differing ethical guidelines and visions for the development and deployment of AI tools.39 This is occurring as the economies of China and the U.S. decouple.40 According to the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace: A partial “decoupling” of U.S. and Chinese technology ecosystems is well underway. Beijing plays an active role in this process, as do other governments and private actors around the world. But the U.S. government has been a primary driver in recent years with its increased use of technology restrictions: export controls, divestment orders, licensing denials, visa bans, sanctions, tariffs, and the like. There is bipartisan support for at least some bolstering of U.S. tech controls, particularly for so-called strategic technologies, where Chinese advancement or influence could most threaten America's national security and economic interests.41 The U.S. enacted extensive export controls in October 2022 to keep semiconductor chips and chipmaking equipment out of China. China, in turn, has made it more difficult for U.S. firms to keep doing business in China.42 Bain & Company reported that “some companies are closing research and development (R&D) labs and other operations there, and setting up partnerships to sell and distribute products developed and made outside of the country.”43 Fears of forced technology transfer and the lack of control over intellectual property (IP) rights44 as well as a general uptick in Chinese bureaucracy for foreign investment make these changes necessary for U.S. *126 corporations.45 It is not just inside the U.S., but the campaign to restrict China's access to high tech components extends to U.S. trading partners.46 Following this Introduction, Part II of this Article provides a very basic explanation of Artificial Intelligence. Part III of this Article explores the ways in which China has set up its own ethical guidelines and varied rules for the future development and use of Artificial Intelligence. The authorities in China have taken some leading steps in reigning in the use of AI for adults and even more so for children.47 Part IV of this Article surveys the ways the U.S. government has regulated AI research and application. The U.S. has developed its own framework and blueprint for action, none of which has yet to be promulgated in legislation.48 These initiatives combine the ideas from industry, government agencies, research institutes, thinktanks, human rights watchdogs, and not-for-profit organizations.49 It is still a blueprint at the end of the day, aspirational rather than operational. This Article concludes in Part V by exploring the importance of national AI guidelines on the ethical use of AI, ML, and like technology. Because this Article is written in the context of the great decoupling between China and the U.S., the European Union (EU) approach is left for another time. Likewise, this Article does not examine in depth the many other countries which have engaged in developing their own national strategies, ethical guidelines, and laws.50 All these varying national developments beg the question whether an international agency should be founded to transnationally regulate AI research and implementation, an issue which is *127 also explored in Part V, the Conclusion, of this Article. The broad spectrum of differing approaches to regulation of the AI industry provides a great opportunity to apply the comparativist's lens.51 Professor John C. Reitz has written: Comparison starts by identifying the similarities and differences between legal systems or parts of legal systems under comparison. However, in performing the basic comparative job of identifying similarities and differences, one has to consider the scope of comparison: What is going to be compared with what? Here the comparatist comes face to face with the enigma of translation.52 Comparative law requires us to acknowledge the differences among legal systems.53 This inquiry goes beyond the classic “beauty contest” asking which system is better, a practice sometimes confined to the common law or civil law tradition.54 But, here the competing “standard” comes from the PRC,55 a jurisdiction that is based on scientific socialism and controlled by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).56 While this Article is not about the rule of law in China,57 there has been *128 much written about the role of guidelines and policy initiatives and their role in providing normative foundations in China.58 There is a hierarchy of laws in China,59 but guidelines, measures, and principles60 as well as governmental and Ministerial statements are also important.61 Viktar Fedaseyeu and Adam Yu have explained: Because Chinese regulators by and large strive to promote economic growth, the interplay between China's implicit and explicit regulations follows a predictable pattern. Initially, innovation (including financial innovation) is often allowed to develop with few if any explicit rules. If and when signs of misbehavior appear, regulators step in by providing *129 implicit guidance rather than issuing explicit rules. If implicit guidance is insufficient to rein in the excesses that government officials are concerned about, explicit (and often strict) regulations follow.62 The lack of transparency of implicit regulations may make a full comparison a little difficult. Nonetheless, Professor Reitz has explained that “[a]ctually framing the comparison makes one think hard about each legal system being compared and about the precise ways in which they are similar or different.”63 As this Article unpacks, there is plenty of technology nationalism in both camps64 not only in pursuing policies to make one's national AI industry the hegemon in the space, but also in the regulation of the space itself. There are, however, many differences including standards for privacy65 and national security.66 Permissions for AI research and deployment are opaque in China. Permissions in the U.S. are not necessary. One can starkly view the difference between the PRC's command economy, national plan driven strategy and the free market, industry-driven, reactive response to AI of the United States.67 The PRC has rolled out a number of guidelines concerning AI research and deployment.68 In contrast, there has been a very public, and slightly haphazard start towards regulation in the U.S.,69 which is part of its non-interventionist market-based approach. In short, in the U.S. there is very little scrutiny of the various uses of Artificial Intelligence.70 But that may change given the changing technological and *130 geopolitical landscape.\"",
    "conclusion": "\"There is a fundamental problem with the guidelines from China and those from the U.S.: they are not law. Guidelines may serve as a convenient reference tool for governments looking to adopt AI technology and make some media headlines. They can help provide minimum standards for effective, responsible public procurement and use of AI--standards that can eventually be adopted by industry and, more importantly, be enshrined into law. Mark Chinen has written: There are good reasons why we would like to steer the development of AI applications, but it has been difficult to govern technology, particularly through harder forms of governance such as laws and regulations, even on the domestic level, let alone on the international plane.291 The U.S. and China are not the only two countries working on AI itself while also working on the regulation of Artificial Intelligence. There has been some highly successful collaboration on regulation coming out of the EU, which first commissioned a High-Level Expert Group on AI which released Guidelines for Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence in April 2019.292 The *157 European Parliament completed the first comprehensive legislation293 in the world concerning the development and use of AI, reaching a deal after three days of negotiations in Brussels on December 8, 2023.294 The legislation must still be voted upon by the European Parliament and the European Council, comprising representatives from the EU's twenty-seven Member States.295 It is drafted in the context of other digital policy priorities like cybersecurity, data privacy (the GDPR), and intellectual property protection, all which predate the EU's AI legislative project. Four years prior, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) announced its own set of five AI principles,296 utilizing a risk-based approach that could become a global benchmark. In 2020 the OECD's Global Partnership on AI and its AI Policy Observatory and Network of Experts on AI supported work among governments to support the development of AI for everyone.297 There is no shortage of examples of best practices among the developed, northern industrialized countries and some developing countries too. For example, Ireland has developed its own national strategy.298 Brazil's Congress has successfully passed a bill that creates a legal framework for AI use.299 So have the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia300 and Germany.301 Israel has also published a set *158 of ethical guidelines on Artificial Intelligence.302 There have been calls to incorporate the various principles and guidelines around the world into a comprehensive framework, understanding how to best integrate them.303 There is a practical reason for this: We operate in a global economy, and many AI projects have co-authors from the U.S. and China. There are Chinese data scientists working at U.S. academic institutions and corporate research laboratories.304 There may indeed be areas for common action from both the U.S. and China as: [I]nternational cooperation will increasingly take the form of issue-specific coalitions instead of truly international (or even regional) institutions. At times, Beijing and Washington might belong to some of the same clubs: for example, when it comes to nonproliferation of cyberweapons and certain kinds of artificial intelligence tools. In the long run, the digital superpowers could even have a shared interest in introducing and enforcing some international regulations to protect their own companies from being overtaxed by other countries.305 Collaboration among policymakers regarding AI regulation is also crucial.306 An index or framework could be developed to adequately translate the various competing guidelines. The Public Voice's Universal Guidelines for Artificial Intelligence is one such effort.307 So is the International Research Center for AI Ethics and Governance.308 The international community must determine how ethics guidelines can be interoperable. Lax AI--or a paucity of AI--standards should not be a competitive advantage for *159 countries seeking to attract the best talent. This should not be a race to the bottom.309 AI requires updates to our regulatory approach and upgrades to our risk architectures. It may be that the world requires an international agency to regulate AI development and deployment across boundaries. Gary Marcus at a TED conference in Vancouver, Canada, “called for the establishment that there be an international institution to help govern A.I.'s development and use.”310 Soon thereafter, in mid-May 2023, the Group of Seven (G7) economic group leaders agreed upon a “Hiroshima AI Process” for the rest of the year to determine a mechanism by which AI is to be regulated.311 It was no surprise that in the summer of 2023, António Guterres, the Secretary General of the United Nations (UN), offered to the international community a new UN agency dedicated to Artificial Intelligence.312 After all, “[t]he United Nations views itself as playing an important role in the development and spread of emerging technologies.”313 In November 2023, UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak brought together political leaders from 28 countries, under the sponsorship of the UN, for an AI Safety Summit.314 The summit, which featured a speech by U.S. Vice-President Kamala Harris, was intended to develop understanding about shared risks and opportunities of *160 AI315 as articulated in the “landmark” Bletchley Declaration.316 For U.K. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, [W]e agreed and published the first ever international statement about the nature of all those risks [concerning AI]. It was signed by every single nation represented at this summit covering all continents across the globe ... and including the US and China. Some said, we shouldn't even invite China ... others that we could never get an agreement with them. Both were wrong. A serious strategy for AI safety has to begin with engaging all the world's leading AI powers.317 But there is one caveat: “Because AI is a multi-faceted capability, “one-size-fits all” regulation will over-regulate in some instances and under-regulate in others.”318 The lack of concreteness or at least legislation, leaves the field empty for non-mandatory, consensus-based guidelines, principles, framework or other loose (or more likely, non-) enforcement.319 The U.S. government must pass legislation that implements a comprehensive national strategy for both the private and public sectors concerning AI, creates a strong set of enforceable regulations for the research and development of the field, and rigorously promotes international partnerships with like-minded countries320 and their corporations. Some worry that this may be too little, too late: The upshot may well be an AI future in which the United States' and Europe's painstaking agreements on safe, rights-respecting AI are rendered obsolete by a world already hardwired with Chinese AI systems--winning Beijing favor among non-Western nations and setting de facto authoritarian standards for the technology's *161 development globally.321 In the end, John C. Reitz warns us that “good comparatists should be sensitive to the ever present limitations on information available about foreign legal systems and should qualify their conclusions if they are unable to have access to sufficient information or if they have reason to suspect that they are missing important information.”322 When it comes to the black box that is China's legal system,323 it is clear we need much more information to understand how the principles and measures announced to date will work together with current laws in force. Maybe by the time we figure out how AI guidelines work in China, the U.S. will have come up with some legislation that may actually pass Congress and get signed into law by the President.\"",

    "abstract": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) started in Wuhan, China, in late 2019, and after being utterly contagious in Asian countries, it rapidly spread to other countries. This disease caused governments worldwide to declare a public health crisis with severe measures taken to reduce the speed of the spread of the disease. This pandemic affected the lives of millions of people. Many citizens that lost their loved ones and jobs experienced a wide range of emotions, such as disbelief, shock, concerns about health, fear about food supplies, anxiety, and panic. All of the aforementioned phenomena led to the spread of racism and hate against Asians in western countries, especially in the United States. An analysis of official preliminary police data by the Center for the Study of Hate & Extremism at California State University shows that Anti-Asian hate crime in 16 of America's largest cities increased by 149% in 2020. In this study, we first chose a baseline of Americans' hate crimes against Asians on Twitter. Then we present an approach to balance the biased dataset and consequently improve the performance of tweet classification. We also have downloaded 10 million tweets through the Twitter API V-2. In this study, we have used a small portion of that, and we will use the entire dataset in the future study. In this article, three thousand tweets from our collected corpus are annotated by four annotators, including three Asian and one Asian-American. Using this data, we built predictive models of hate speech using various machine learning and deep learning methods. Our machine learning methods include Random Forest, K-nearest neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Naive Bayes. Our Deep Learning models include Basic Long-Term Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Bidirectional LSTM, Bidirectional LSTM with Drop out, Convolution, and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT). We also adjusted our dataset by filtering tweets that were ambiguous to the annotators based on low Fleiss Kappa agreement between annotators. Our final result showed that Logistic Regression achieved the best statistical machine learning performance with an F1 score of 0.72, while BERT achieved the best performance of the deep learning models, with an F1-Score of 0.85.",
    "conclusion": "\"We presented a study on recognizing hate speech toward Asians on the Twitter platform during COVID-19. Our contributions in this study are 1) We created a dataset consisting of 10 million tweets related to both COVID-19 and Asians. 2) We chose a baseline that is recent research similar to our topic. 3) We annotated 3,000 tweets by four Asian annotators, and 1,901 of them are the same as our previously annotated baseline. 4) We applied many machine learning and deep learning algorithms to the baseline to find the most accurate one. 5) We improved the performance of the classifiers by measuring the Fleiss Kappa agreement and balancing the dataset accordingly. 6) By filtering only 11.46% of the tweets with a low agreement between raters, we achieved an F1-Score of 0.85 using BERT. Therefore, we conclude that the classifier’s performance in hate speech detection on Twitter is related to the agreement between annotators in labeling the data. In addition to the above experiment, we analyzed the features of tweets with high vs. low agreement to understand what kind of language is easily labeled and what kind is more ambiguous. To perform this task, we focus on the following tweets: Tweets labeled unanimously by all five annotators mean the agreement number is 1. • Tweets with the lowest agreement. We used the threshold <= 0.3 to find these tweets. We did this analysis on our dataset from phase 2 by making two following sub-datasets: • Tweets with the complete agreement between annotators, tweets with the agreement 1. There are 758 tweets with agreement 1 in our annotated dataset • Ambiguous tweets that are tweets with agreement <= 0.3, and there are 135 of them in our dataset Figures 2D,E, show the distribution of ambiguous tweets and tweets with the full agreement between annotators in three classes. These figures show that fewer hateful tweets are ambiguous, and more ambiguous tweets are from counterhate and neutral classes, which is not a far-fetched argument. Figures3D,E are wordcloud of these two datasets. They demonstrate that the words racism most common phrases of racismIsVirus, racist, and China, are the most common words in the ambiguous dataset, which means their presence did not help recognize the tweet category. We hope that this study will contribute toward an increased understanding of anti-Asian hate speech on social media, and will help identify and reduce this toxic content.\"",

We test hypotheses about property rights insecurity using novel firm-level administrative data that cover the universe of Chinese firms from 1998 to 2012.

    "conclusion": "\"Using novel administrative data covering the universe of firms in China, we provide evidence of the profound effects of property rights protections afforded by the 2007 Property Law on the founding and survival of privately owned firms. The 2007 law was a landmark piece of legislation that equated private property with public property, previously the only type of asset ownership recognized in China’s 1982 constitution. The Property Law amended the constitution and made citizens’ private property rights as inviolable as the state’s public property rights. We conducted the study using a panel of prefectures from 1998 to 2012. We ac- counted for the extent of property rights insecurity in each prefecture before the law was enacted by measuring the prevalence of privately owned firms in 2005. This is a continuous measure, defined as the proportion of firms in 2005 that were privately owned. The smaller this proportion, the greater the property rights inse- ­ Table 7 Aggregate Output Gross Domestic Product Growth Night Lighting Growth Initial Private Firmsi × Postlaw -.270* -.369* (.092) (.171) N 4,078 4,545 Adjusted R2 .693 .655 Note.

We argue that the prelaw prevalence of privately owned firms is conditionally independent of potential outcomes. We find that the Property Law led to an increase in the number of new pri- vately owned firms, their size (measured by number of employees), and their number of survivors. This study uses the Property Law as a quasi ­ experiment to demonstrate the counterfactual to de Soto’s dead capital and shows that the law mitigated this problem and brought dead capital to life. Furthermore, the protec- tions afforded by the law had significant real effects: new firms rapidly increased their output, sales revenue, and assets, and the number of privately owned firms that became exporters in the years immediately after they were founded sharply increased. Behrer et al. (2021) hypothesize that when courts are subverted, prop- erty rights are ineffective; this accurately describes the prelaw business environ- ment in China. We affirm this hypothesis for small firms without the resources to bargain with corrupt courts. By guaranteeing the security of their property rights, the law led small entrepreneurs who otherwise would not have invested to do so. The opposite was true for SOEs, which indicates that the law initiated the process of reallocation. More direct evidence of this is observed in macro outcomes-the law caused faster growth in prefectures with greater prelaw property rights inse- curity. The results test and support the Besley and Ghatak (2009) models that apply the property rights theory of the firm developed by Grossman and Hart (1986) and Hart and Moore (1990) to the development context. For example, we find that the new property rights protections created more firms in contract-­ intensive industries (Nunn 2007). Some of our findings are even stronger than the Besley-Ghatak predictions. A striking finding is that in prefectures that experienced greater improvements in property rights security, more new firms proved their mettle as exporters within 2 or 3 years of entry. This unusually short duration contributes new evidence to the trade and institutions literature and suggests new theories on the trade-­ and-­ institutions nexus. A within-­ firm investigation, especially in contract-­ intensive industries, of why firms adopted specific organizational hierarchies, and whether they are consistent with firm boundaries as predicted by the property rights theory of the firm, is one way to build on the results in this paper. Examining firms in China before and after the law can provide insight into foundational questions that remain unan- swered (Segal and Whinston 2013): Are simple contracts (for example, property rights) preferred over more sophisticated contracts (for example, call options as in Maskin and Tirole [1999]), and if so why? Moreover, is renegotiation prevalent or is the need to renegotiate overstated by the property rights theory of the firm (Hart and Moore 1990)? The benefit of the quasi ­ experiment presented by the Property Law in China is that it provides a clean slate for tackling these questions, since the only ownership right recognized prior to the law was public ownership.\"",

    "abstract": "\"Bureaucrat-assisted contention in China is a type of collective action in which native-born local officials help socioeconomic elites launch or sustain popular action against outsider party sec- retaries by leaking information and sabotaging repression. Bureaucrats who assist local in- fluentials are neither elite allies nor institutional activists. Instead, they unleash or support collective action as a weapon in a power struggle against ambitious, heavy-handed or corrupt superiors. Unlike mass demonstrations that are mobilized as a bargaining chip, bureaucrat- assisted contention hinges on a partnership with local elites who have their own grievances and pursue their own goals. Because it combines bureaucratic politics and popular action, this type of contention can help us understand underexplored aspects of political opportunities, framing, and mobilizing structures. In particular, it shows how participants in contention sometimes span the state-society divide, and how collective action can influence (and be influenced by) power struggles within a government.\"",
    "conclusion": "As the episodes discussed in this article have made clear, bureaucrat-assisted contention is difficult to pull off but often works. A coalition of convenience between native-born officials and local elites can generate enough pressure, when coupled with social mobilization, to get the better of a party secretary in a district, county, or even a province. Ironically, in a regime obsessed with “harmony” (hexie) and stability, the disruptiveness that makes bureaucrat- assisted contention relatively uncommon can also make it effective, by showing officials at higher levels that something is seriously awry. This echoes the popular Chinese saying that “big disturbances lead to big solutions, small disturbances lead to small solutions, and no disturbance leads to no solution,” (Cai 2010: 112)1 and suggests that although mobilizing the disaffected and making a commotion is risky in an authoritarian setting, drawing together a range of aggrieved parties, crossing the state-society border, and creating a spectacle (O’Brien and Deng 2015: 470) can produce results. Bureaucrat-assisted contention is of course not always successful, and more research is needed to understand when and where it fails. Still, repeated recourse to this type of collective action can have lasting consequences by reconfiguring the relationship between secretaries, local officials, and socioeconomic elites. Once they force concessions or drive a secretary away, native-born bureaucrats are inclined to revive their cooperation with local influentials and launch contention again against a secretary’s successor. Aware of what happened last time, new appointees are often more cautious and work harder to avoid simultaneously alienating local officials and elites. Over time, bureaucrat-assisted contention may not even need to be unleashed to have an effect. After more than a decade when maintaining stability has been the regime’s top priority (Zhou and Yan 2014), a credible threat is often sufficient to check a secretary’s power, ambitions or avarice. At the same time, it should be noted that although bureaucrat-assisted contention is invariably carried out in the name of a locality, success does not always benefit local residents or even the people who were mobilized to take part. In Shifang county, Sichuan province, for example, a group of mine owners joined forces with native-born officials to stage a noisy antipollution protest that halted the construction of a large, new smelting operation. But the bureaucrats and business people had colluded simply to drive out a competitor who the mine owners feared would be a more efficient and cleaner competitor, and who the officials worried would be more difficult to shake down. The contention and its reputation for instability turned the county into an “orphan” (guer) that was out of favor with higher levels of government and investors. The collective action had succeeded in blocking the new plant, but the county lost out on a 13.7 billion yuan (US$2.2 billion) investment that would have boosted local incomes, while the mine operators continued to pollute as much as they had before (Yan Dingfei 2014; interview 9). For students of social movements, bureaucrat-assisted contention draws attention to some less-appreciated aspects of three concepts that have been at the heart of the field for decades. First, it says something unexpected about divisions within the state and defections that provide openings for social forces. Opportunities can arise when a leader pushes subordinates into the arms of local elites who have their own complaints about the leader. Institutional tensions and alienating decisions can generate a rough-and-ready partnership that unites middle-level bureau- crats and influential members of society who have the wherewithal to mobilize the public. Second, like everything associated with bureaucratic-assisted contention, frame alignment cuts across the state-society divide. Local elites use leaked information to turn broad grievances (e.g. dissatisfaction with the environment) into actionable demands. With crucial assistance from within the state, claims home in on a named culprit and specified offences, and bureaucrats and local elites draw on hometown pride to package their charges in a discourse that emphasizes protecting local interests. Lastly, as with opportunities and framing, mobilizing structures span state and society. Leaders antagonize local influentials and subordinates within the government. Although local elites deploy social networks and other means to pull the public into contention, what stands out is how much of the impetus for protest lies within the state, and how actions by leaders and their subordinates both fuel collective action. Bureaucrat-assisted contention also reminds us that familiar concepts such as opportunity and mobilizing structures must be contextualized when they travel to illiberal countries that lack active intermediary organizations. This type of collective action arises in China not because SMOs exploit splits within the state, as is often seen in more open societies, but because disaffected officials inside a divided state look outward and cobble together an alliance with societal forces. China’s dearth of SMOs, in this sense, is a structural feature of its authoritarian system that draws three aggrieved parties together and leads native-born officials to a build a makeshift, informal mobilizing structure that, to some degree, takes the place of a conventional SMO, and makes coordination and collective action possible. In this challenging opportunity structure, what appears to be a strength of the state (i.e., its ability to suppress civil society organizations) can create a vulnerability, and what appears reckless for officials (i.e., mobilizing elites and fomenting contention) can be an effective way to confront one’s superiors. Bureaucrat-assisted contention neither fits snugly in state-society ways of thinking nor with imagining that a thick, black line exists between members of the state and challengers. Instead, it highlights two actors (bureaucrats and local elites) in a four-party game that also includes leaders and the public. Contention originates in the middle reaches of the government and is energized by a bureaucratic power struggle that draws in aggrieved people from the higher reaches of society. The impetus for protest is shared and midlevel officials are full-fledged participants in contention, not just champions, elite allies or “institutional activists” (Santoro and McGuire 1997; Yang 2019; Ma 2019). Bureaucrat-assisted contention is mutually con- stituted and hinges on parties working across the state-society divide. Disaffected bureaucrats and elites both play a critical role, as each pursues a common target for their own reasons, with the public brought in as a supporting player to ratchet the pressure up one final notch.",

In Hunan province, resistance to excessive taxation in the 1990s and early 2000s was spirited and persistent, in part owing to bureaucrats who tipped off protest leaders when party secretaries dispatched the police to arrest them (Li and O’Brien 2008; Zhang 2015a; Zhang 2015b). The resistance to land appropriation in Jinning county, Yunnan province lasted from 2012 to 2014. It continued for so long in large part because of the support of a provincial official and other cadres who provided the local elites who led the protest with evidence of the provincial secretary’s corruption (Liu 2014; interview 3). That the bureau-cracy itself could be used as a mobilizing structure reminds us of the opportunities provided by a far-flung, multilevel state where officials are not always on the same page and that movement entrepreneurs can be located both within the bureaucracy and in society.",

    "abstract": "\"The superposition of artificial intelligence (AI) and non-state power has aggravated changes in state functions, and has downgraded centralism of political state. The “Intelligent Leviathan” will persist in objectifying the “individual.” The relationship mode of “human-human” being transformed into the mode of “human- technology-human, ” is giving rise to a new social structure, while state power together with non-state power, law and the algorithm, as well as ethics and technologies, are creating a new order. The major threat to freedoms and rights is horizontal non-state power, instead of vertical state power. Going through profound changes, legal scenarios need reconstruction of “kindness” dimension for balancing the “rights priority” theory, while the “obligations standard” should be recovered in the sense of legal technology to rectify the “rights standard” and to resolve the “rights disability.”",
    "conclusion": "\"Rationalism in modern times has encouraged our self-confidence and conceit. Humans believe that they have led the evolutionary path of everything on earth and have mastered the fundamental principles of nature. They have also discovered the laws of human social development, and have answered major questions related to primary propositions of philosophy and ethics. However, the newly established human confidence, accompanied by the development of big data, AI and even quantum mechanics, has been unstable and even shaken. “As the world begins to enter the age of big data, our society will also experience similar enormous changes.” 34 However, facing disruptive changes in production and lifestyles and in the development of science and technology from the perspective of historical development, humans are instinctive to utilize the existing knowledge framework to absorb the impact of changes, or deliberately shut our eyes. Although we are not scientific determinists, we must admit that the history of human science is a history of human thought, as science leads development. Human scientific concepts determine human concepts of nature and universe, and determine concepts of humans, freedom, order and nation, which are finally reflected in legal concepts and rules. With the in-depth development of big data and AI technology, the old knowledge framework, theoretical propositions, theoretical paradigms, and social development laws (if any) will undergo fundamental changes. The future development of AI civilization is unpredictable, but what has been realized up to date and what to be realized soon according to the development trend have undoubtedly constituted our lives, and new scenarios for law formulation and legal research. Facing unprecedented changes in human civilization, we can no longer apply the existing theories and norms or attempt to fill an old bottle with new wine through conceptual replacement, redefining the meaning or expanding the interpretation. Although most of the existing laws and most of the rules of law are not yet in a holistic crisis, world revolution and legal system revolution are often started up by small events. How can online virtual property be placed in the civil law system? Is the “notification-permission” privacy protection system still valuable in the age of big data? These seemingly local questions are enough to spark the chain collapse of the entire power framework and legal system, not to mention the ultimate question on whether we are still free in front of Intelligent Leviathan. Repairing and reforming the existing constitutional framework and legal system is insignificant and cannot meet the needs of technological development and social changes anymore, nor can mitigate the uncertainties and risks that may come with the development of AI. Laws should be open to AI and promote technological and social innovation with minimal intervention. Laws should also be inherently conservative to AI. Resetting the relationships between the state, society and citizens, between humans and technology, and between freedoms and order, laws should adjust the functional concept of legal rights and the rights protection models for effective control of uncertainties and risks.\"",

    "abstract": "\"Personal data have great economic interest today and their possession and control are the object of geopolitics, leading to their regulation by means that vary dependent on the strategic objectives of the jurisdiction considered. This study fills a gap in the literature in this area by analyzing holistically the regulation of personal data flows both into and from China, the world’s second largest economy. In doing so, it focuses on laws and regulations of three major power blocs: the United States, the European Union, and China, seen within the framework of geopolitics, and considering the rise of Chinese big tech. First, this study analyzes ways that the United States-the champion of the free- flow of data that has helped feed the success of the Silicon Valley system-has in specific cases prevented data flows to China on grounds of individual data protection and national security. The danger of this approach and alternate protection through potential U.S. federal data privacy legislation are evoked. Second, the cross-border data flow restriction of the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is studied in the context of data exports to China, including where the data transit via the United States prior to their transfer to China. Next, after review of the conditions for a European Commission adequacy determination and an examination of recent data privacy legislation in China, the authors provide a preliminary negative assessment of the potential for such a determination for China, where government access is an important part of the picture. Difficult points are highlighted for investigation by data exporters to China, when relying on EU transfer mechanisms, following the Schrems II jurisprudence.\"",
    "conclusion": "\"Data may be a source of government power in terms of national security and competitiveness. As a result, today personal data protection is the object of geopolitics, and the three main power blocs covered by this study-the United States, the European Union, and China-all have different strategic objectives, which influence their choice of the nature of regulation of personal data. The United States, which historically built its self-regulatory system in a way that encouraged the development of U.S. big tech that is centered in Silicon Valley, has chosen a neoliberal policy. The European Union, which considers data protection as a fundamental right, places the focus on protecting an individual’s rights with respect to the processing of his or her personal data. In addition, the extraterritorial effect of EU data protection legislation may be seen to level the regulatory playing field with U.S. and Chinese big tech. Finally, China’s view on data protection is closely linked to national security, social control and power, with government access to data as an important characteristic. These different data protection cultures are reflected in the way that each bloc has chosen to regulate data flows-at the heart of this study which concerns flows both into and out of China. Although not largely covered previously in the literature, and certainly not in the same holistic fashion, data transfer regulation into and out of China has become of great interest today because of a dawning era of Chinese big tech. Recent and existing regulation may be seen on a spectrum with the United States described as light touch, the European Union as prescriptive with conditional transfer, and China as being categorized into the restrictive or guarded approach, with transfer restrictions under PIPL and other regulation and data localization under the CSL. In each case, strategic goals are furthered by the choice of regulation. However, this picture is neither black nor white, as this study has shown. While the United States promotes free flow of data around the world, when U.S. individual privacy has been affected by certain Chinese or Chinese- controlled firms, the United States has taken regulatory or executive action to prohibit transfers and effectively encourage what might be called soft data localization. This has occurred in a period of obvious tension between China and the United States. Yet, the adoption of U.S. federal data privacy legislation, under consideration in the U.S. legislature today, may be one way to provide the legal tools necessary to control certain data flows, without resort to case-by-case executive orders, although this is a matter for future study. While the few cases cited in this article do not indicate a systemic change yet, and U.S. limitation of transfers is nothing like the data transfer restrictions of either of the other two blocs, continuing tensions may change this. One question this study leaves open, then, is will the United States lean more to a EU-style prescriptive approach with conditional transfers, or will it balance more toward a Chinese-style national security model, or neither of the two? The European Union’s position is based on established law, which in today’s GDPR, is merely an evolution of the 1995 Directive adopted twenty- nine years ago. It sets out relatively clear criteria for obtaining an adequacy determination, allowing the free flow of data between the European Union and the “adequate” importing nation. However, today China does not benefit from such a determination and does not enjoy the same geopolitical position with respect to Europe as the United States does, which allowed that nation to benefit from the Safe Harbor and the Privacy Shield data agreements in the past and now from the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework data agreement. Thus, adequate safeguards must be used to allow for personal data flows from the European Union to China, and these may be conditioned on the use of supplemental measures, as well. A preliminary analysis by this study of the prospects of an eventual Commission adequacy determination leads to a negative answer, even if China’s PIPL features characteristics from the GDPR. Furthermore, some aspects of China’s data protection laws and regulation cause concern for the use of adequate safeguards such as EU SCCs to transfer data to China without supplemental measures and, even then, if the importer could comply with those clauses in the face of the Chinese government’s right to access data, presumably without the necessary procedural protections that a Schrems II transfer assessment would require. In the meantime, EU regulators may be more watchful of Chinese firms in this new age of Chinese big tech. With respect to outgoing flows from China, this study has shown that, while data transfer regulations have not been finally fleshed out with interpretative guidance, they should be seen to be subject to considerations of national strategic concerns. The security assessment, mandatory for many data transfers, intertwine data protection and national security. In addition, CSL’s data localization requirements have broad scope and limit the ability to export personal data when they apply. In conclusion, it is likely that data flows into and out of China will continue to be subject to regulatory restraints, which may be amplified by actions in the United States, and that this situation is likely to endure over time. Geopolitical goals of the three power blocs reviewed in this study are varying and have led to different regulatory approaches to data transfers. Of course, as this study has shown, these regulatory approaches are also linked to different forms of power sought by the blocs. However, these impact the rights of individuals and economic activities of businesses, who will have to navigate these different regulations.\"",

    "abstract": "\"What is the impact of anticorruption efforts on entry into bureaucratic jobs? This paper approaches the question theoretically and empirically through the lens of China’s anticorruption campaign instituted in 2013. We leverage a novel data set of national civil service exams. Exploiting assignment and tim- ing variations in anticorruption inspections of government departments, our difference-­ in-differences estimate shows that a department had significantly fewer applicants following an inspection. We provide evidence that the decline in bureaucratic entry has occurred since the campaign lowered the (expected) returns from bureaucratic jobs by improving the detection of corruption and constraining power that is likely to be abused. In contrast, we do not find evi- dence that the campaign affected legal income. Furthermore, simulation exer- cises suggest that after the anticorruption campaign, incoming bureaucrats may have lower ability but higher prosociality than before.\"",
    "conclusion": "\"This paper studies how China’s anticorruption campaign since 2013 has af- fected bureaucratic entry. Leveraging novel data sources, we document that the anticorruption campaign has caused a significant decrease in the number of ap- plicants to bureaucratic jobs. Consistent with predictions of a stylized model of job choice, there is evidence that the decrease in bureaucratic entry can be due to improved corruption detection and constraints of bureaucratic power, both of which lower the expected returns of bureaucratic jobs. Moreover, people entering the bureaucracy after the campaign may possess lower ability but higher prosoci- ality on average. Our findings provoke several additional thoughts that could be interesting av- enues for future research. First, how can the anticorruption campaign influence the state capacity of China? The reduced labor supply to the bureaucracy may be consequential as there are fewer people to carry out policies. Meanwhile, lower ability but higher prosociality of incoming bureaucrats may have mixed impli- cations for governance. More empirical evidence is needed to nail down the im- pacts on state capacity. Second, how does the anticorruption campaign influence economic development? Related to the first thought, changes in state capacity should influence the economy. Perhaps more important, the campaign may alter the allocation of talent in China as it may drive talent away from less productive (and rent-seeking) bureaucracy (Murphy, Shleifer, and Vishny 1991). Third, the findings indicate that some people may have joined the bureaucracy because of corruption opportunities. Therefore, reforms of bureaucratic recruitment may be necessary to screen out corrupt applicants. We close this paper by noting some limitations. First, our paper focuses on China’s anticorruption campaign, which may inevitably restrict external validity. To the extent that low-ranking bureaucratic positions are similar across countries (note that people can access low-ranking jobs only through NCSEs), the results may provide some useful implications for anticorruption efforts in other con- texts. Nonetheless, some unique characteristics of China should not be neglected. Unlike the situation in many other countries, the Chinese bureaucracy connects to the political arena: many politicians start their careers as bureaucrats. In ad- dition, state dominance is also unique in China, which creates rents for bureau- crats and makes bureaucratic jobs highly privileged. If certain similarities can be drawn from other contexts, our findings may be more generalizable. Second, the analysis of the anticorruption campaign is in a relatively static world, where there are no substantial macro shocks. After the COVID-19 pandemic, the interest in bureaucratic jobs resurged amid the anticorruption campaign. We speculate that the stability of bureaucratic jobs prevailed during recessions, which suggests that the sociopolitical environment is key. Studying and comparing how the anticor- ruption efforts influence bureaucratic entry in more nuanced settings is an inter- esting direction for future research.\"",

      "authorsDataDescription": "Overview. Figure 3 outlines some important events in the course of the an- ticorruption campaign. Shortly after coming to power, Xi initiated an anticor- ruption campaign in early 2013, which is arguably the most intense anticorrup- tion effort since China’s communist rule (Chen and Kung 2019; Ang 2020; Wang 2022). Anticorruption stories are widely circulated by media outlets, social me- dia, and word of mouth (Wang and Dickson 2022; Zhuang 2022). Given the cam- paign’s high profile and extensive publicity, people, especially those looking for bureaucratic jobs, should have been informed of and reacted to changes in the bureaucracy induced by the anticorruption campaign.8 Two aspects of these changes can strongly influence people’s interest in bu- reaucratic jobs. First, the campaign has featured strict enforcement, which has largely improved corruption detection. It has cracked down on a large number of corrupt bureaucrats. By 2017, over 335,000 bureaucrats had been investigated for corruption (Wang and Dickson 2022). Notably, many high-ranking bureaucrats, who would have been able to get leniency in the past, were also disciplined.9 For example, Zhou Yongkang, a former member of the Politburo Standing Commit- tee (China’s governing body), was punished for corruption.",

    "abstract": "\"Over the past ten years, under the leadership of President Xi Jinping, the People’s Republic of China (PRC)/Chinese Communist Party (CCP) party-state has pursued a more assertive strategy in deploying the tools of economic statecraft to protect its growing global interests.1 Through increased trade, financial, and business ties in hundreds of countries around the world, China has leveraged its economic power to achieve political ends and contest the US-led global world order.2 From Quito to Colombo, economic ties are the key entry point for all other forms of PRC influence and are foundational to the PRC’s goal of creating a world safe for the party,3 one that is more amenable its authoritarian model of governance and which allows China to return to its self-avowed rightful place at “the center for the world stage.”4 Whether creating export dependencies on access to the Chinese market or cultivating business elites to serve as powerful lobbying constituencies in other countries’ politics, Beijing recognizes that economic ties often translate into political influence.5 Creating economic interdependence between China and other nations is thus a core aspect of the PRC’s efforts to cultivate influence - some of it legitimate, in other instances corrosive - in other societies.6 Capitalizing on strengthened economic connections,7 China has expanded its influence around the globe, exerting its influence in both the political and informational arenas, and undermining democracy and the rules-based international system in the process. This article outlines the fundamental elements of economic statecraft employed by the PRC.8 It explores the PRC’s strategic use of economic power to wield political influence and advance its global objectives and evaluates the repercussions of economic coercion on targeted societies, drawing insights from case studies in Brazil and Lithuania.9 The conclusion offers recommendations for strengthening and reforming multilateral mechanisms to counter coercion in defense of international law and the liberal world order.\"",
    "conclusion": "\"The PRC’s strategic use of economic statecraft encompasses a nuanced and extensive array of tools to shape global politics. From trade dependencies to infrastructure investments and direct retaliatory measures, China’s economic influence is a crucial aspect of its foreign policy, impacting nations’ decision-making processes and fostering dependencies that encourage or coerce states to align with its geopolitical objectives. Perceived reliance on trade with China influences foreign policy choices, leading to potential reversals of decisions criticized by the PRC and passive shaping of behavior. Corrupt practices associated with infrastructure investment and financing provide leverage over foreign leaders and business figures, reinforcing ties to China. Elite capture creates proxies supporting the PRC’s objectives, aligning with China’s interests over broader public concerns. The PRC’s comprehensive government control facilitates official and unofficial boycotts, pressure to induce behavior change in return for access to the PRC market, and other retaliatory measures against countries that do not comply with Beijing’s dictates. These strategies seek to garner political influence and support for the PRC in pursuit of its core objectives. The PRC employs various mechanisms, including the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), trade, and infrastructure financing, to extend its influence over the Global South.90 The tactic of threatening to terminate or withhold PRC-funded projects often compels nations to align with China’s stances at the United Nations, eroding international norms, standards, and state sovereignty. China employs economic incentives and penalties to shape countries’ diplomatic interactions concerning Taiwan. Through a discerning use of coercive measures, the PRC induces self-censorship among policymakers, fostering alignment with Beijing’s preferences. Economic coercion serves as a punitive tool against nations or entities that diverge from China’s desired course of action. The impact of PRC economic coercion in achieving desired political outcomes is nevertheless challenging to assess due to a mix of factors beyond direct economic impact. These include the deterrent effect, self-censorship, and considerations such as popular sentiment, economic realities, and geopolitical concerns. The impact of PRC coercion varies significantly between democratically and economically resilient states, which can withstand such pressure, and states with weak democratic institutions and economies more susceptible to coercion and corruption. Irrespective of the outcome, the intent of PRC economic coercion is to advance pro-Beijing policies, deter and censor critics, and challenge international institutions and norms at the expense of democracy and the liberal world order. By using economic pressure to advance political influence, China attempts to reshape global governance structures in a way that is more favorable to its interests. A global response to counter PRC economic coercion is critical to promoting a balanced and resilience international economic and political environment and mitigating the impact of PRC efforts to undermine it to its advantage. Collaborative regional and multilateral actions enhance collective influence and leverage against the PRC to more effectively counter coercion. Crucial to this effort is the reinforcement of shared norms and standards and existing international mechanisms in order to strengthen deterrence, provide recourse for countries impacted by coercion, and hold the PRC accountable. A multilateral response to PRC economic coercion is imperative to foster a united front among nations, ensuring collective resilience, safeguarding the protection of individual countries from undue pressure or manipulation, and upholding the principles of fair trade and the rules of the international system.\"",

The evolving landscape of international trade demands a proactive response from the WTO, necessitating updates to its rules to effectively address the growing challenges of economic coercion.

The existing rules fail to address the informal and undocumented nature of much coercion, particularly in the grey zone. Adapting to contemporary geopolitical dynamics is crucial for ensuring that the WTO remains a robust and relevant institution in safeguarding fair and equitable global trade practices. Lastly, states must continue to use existing mechanisms, including the WTO dispute settlement system for violations of international trade rules, unfair trade practices, or breaches of China’s WTO commitments and human rights mechanisms where coercion impacts labor rights, freedom of expression, or other relevant issues. Despite their limitations, these mechanisms should be employed when feasible to hold aggressors accountable for coercion. Despite potential challenges in achieving a favorable outcome through these avenues, registering a complaint within these established systems reinforces their legitimacy and authority.

    "conclusion": "\"Charles S. Y. Yu was born during the twilight of China’s last imperial dynasty. He received his librarian training at China’s renowned Boone Library School, established by American missionary librarian and educator Mary E. Wood. His appointment as the librarian of the CLSC in 1931 marked the dawn of the law librarian profession in China. Despite the challenges of civil war and the Japanese invasion, he tirelessly advocated for law library science. He played a key role in establishing a well-equipped and nationally acclaimed law library. With a fervent desire to further his education, Yu eagerly awaited an opportunity to study in the United States. In 1948, when the chance arose, he seized it and pursued graduate studies at Columbia University’s School of Library Service. However, on his return to China in late 1949, during a tumultuous period, Yu’s aspira- tions to contribute to library science education and practice in China were thwarted. Despite acquiring new knowledge and methods of library administration, the prevailing circumstances hindered his ability to make any contributions to the field. ¶58 By uncovering the life and work of this historic, pathbreaking Chinese law librarian, this article hopes to contribute to improving our understanding of historical Sino-American exchange in the library field and the humanization of the history of Chinese law librarians.

    "abstract": "\"Over the past decade, China has been slowly yet steadily opening up its market for recognising and assisting foreign insolvency proceedings. The Supreme People's Court of China (SPC), in the 2014 Thumb case 1 , first recognised the status of foreign insolvency representatives in China. However, this recognition was limited to the capacity of foreign representatives to manage affairs of Chinese subsidiaries on behalf of the foreign parent companies but did not extend to allowing them to remit insolvency assets into their home proceedings. In 2017, SPC introduced a more adaptable presumption reciprocity to replace the previously rigid de facto reciprocity. 2 On 14 May 2021, SPC and the Hong Kong government signed the Record of Meeting on Mutual Recognition of and Assistance to Insolvency Proceedings Between Mainland China and Hong Kong courts (Meeting Record). To this end, SPC also issued the Opinions on Taking Forward a Pilot Measure concerning the Recognition of and Assistance to Insolvency Proceedings in Hong Kong (Pilot Opinion), using UNCITRL Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency as a reference. The Pilot Opinion has been tested in two cases to be effective. 3 Scholars optimistically believe that these judicial moves are progressively paving the way for adopting the 1997 Model Law in Mainland China. 4 However, there have been concerns that the trend towards the adoption of the Model Law in China may be at a crucial turning point. In a recent Insolvency case, Re China Evergrande Group 5 , the High Court of Hong Kong ordered to winding-up of Evergrande and appointed liquidators. Judge Linda Chan, who ruled on this case, said she has had ‘enough is enough’ of Evergrande's repeated failures to present a proper debt restructuring plan, so liquidation may be the better option for protecting the interests of creditors. 6 Nevertheless, this move may be a drawn-out process for foreign creditors, as over 90% of its assets available for liquidation are in Mainland China. 7 This winding-up order in Hong Kong places China's cross-border insolvency law in the spotlight. An unavoidable question is whether or to what extent this winding-up order in Hong Kong will be respected and enforced by Mainland China's courts. Although a new recognition and assistance mechanism for insolvency proceedings has been established between Mainland China and Hong Kong, it is unclear how the Chinese courts will treat this liquidation order. After all, the catastrophic ripple effects of the ongoing Evergrande crisis on China's financial, property markets, as well as on political and social stability. This winding-up order issued by the Hong Kong High Court places the Chinese government between a rock and a hard place. There are two options available to the Chinese government to respond to Evergrande's liquidation order, although each option has its unique challenges. First, the Chinese courts can assist the Hong Kong liquidators in collecting, administering and distributing Evergrande's assets located in China in accordance with the Pilot Opinion. By doing so, it allows foreign investors to be confident that their investments located in China will be treated fairly and safely, facilitating the maintenance of their enthusiasm and confidence in the Chinese market. Yet, how the Pilot Opinion will protect 1.6mn Evergrande's pre-sold-but- unfinished homebuyers are crucial assessments of whether the Mainland courts will recognise this winding-up order. 8 More precisely, in insolvency proceedings, those owners of unfinished housing would become non-adjusting creditors who need priority protection from Chinese courts; otherwise, they would be a potential source of social discontent. 9 Another way is that Beijing sticks to its previous domestic protectionism in cross-border insolvency, that is, dismissing Hong Kong's liquidation order and forbidding Evergrande's complete insolvency in Mainland China. Evergrande is a main representative of the Chinese real estate market. The real estate sector contributes a quarter of China's GDP, and over 70% of the personal wealth composition of Chinese households is closely tied to real estate ownership. 10 Evergrande's sudden meltdown could induce a disorderly collapse of house prices in China, resulting in a massive loss of resident's wealth. However, rejecting the liquidation order could mean that the claims of foreign creditors would be little satisfied as Evergrande has fewer overseas assets. Such disparate treatment may discourage foreign investors from investing in the Chinese market, which in turn will make it more difficult for Chinese businesses to access global capital markets in the future. Against this backdrop, this article examines and estimates the possible regulatory stance of Chinese policymakers towards this winding-up order in Hong Kong. This article is composed of four parts. After this introduction, Part Two elaborates on what the ongoing Evergrande debt crisis is really like by tracing the factors that contributed to its debt crisis. Part Three answers the question of whether Evergrande is ‘too big to fail’ by analysing its catastrophic economic, political, and social stability implications. Part Four assess the possible regulatory stance of Chinese policymakers toward this winding-up order in Hong Kong.\"",
    "conclusion": "\"In conclusion, whether or to what extent this winding-up order will be enforced will be a test of how far the Chinese policymakers are willing to go to tackle the cross-border debt default of Chinese enterprises. The first two parts analyses the nature of the ongoing Evergrande debt crisis, finding The Chinese central government does not seem to regard Evergrande as ‘too big to fail’. Instead, it sees runaway debt and leverage in the real estate sector as a life-and-death risk for China's overall economic health. Meanwhile, the Chinese central government sees the ongoing Evergrande debt crisis as ‘a controlled implosion’, provided that Evergrande goes through a slow insolvency or orderly restructuring under strict government control. It appears willing to reduce over-reliance on the previous growth engine at the cost of the economic pain caused by some real estate giants. The fourth part explores the cross-border insolvency solution to the Evergrande debt crisis by answering two questions. The first question is to discuss the legal basis for Hong Kong liquidators seeking recognition of insolvency proceedings in the Mainland China. The second question is to discuss whether or to what extent the Pilot Opinion can recognise and assist Hong Kong's liquidation order. It finds that the Mainland Chinese courts should recognise this Hong Kong's winding-up order against Evergrande. It is widely acknowledged that this crisis exerts severe and far-reaching implications in many aspects, so it cannot be dealt with from a cross-border insolvency perspective in silos. Instead, this crisis needs to be resolved in a way that addresses cross-border insolvency, financial security, protection of owners of pre-sold-but-unfinished homes and rational realisation of Evergrande's land reserves in concert. For example, even though the liquidators could realise or transfer Evergrande's 230mn square metres of land reserves, it is not an appropriate time to sell these lands. After all, the property market in China is weak right now that large-scale, rushed land sales could lead to further depressed prices by buyers, harming the interest of all creditors.\"",

    "abstract": "Based on a comparison between the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022 (the ; CHIPS Act) in the United States and the European Chips Act of 2023 (the EU Chips Act), this article explores the latent inefficacy of both acts, given the potential of the development of China's disruptive technology to revolutionize chip manufacturing. The study contends that traditional approaches outlined in both acts might be rendered outdated by emerging technology-based paradigms, particularly those embodied by existing multiple patterning and emerging particle accelerator technologies. By elucidating the transformative potential inherent in multiple patterning and particle acceleration together with the pioneering Steady-State Microbunching (SSMB) technologies, this analysis offers a discerning evaluation of the effectiveness of these chip laws in navigating the intricate dynamics of contemporary semiconductor fabrication. Two analytical frameworks, the disruptive innovation and path dependency theories, can offer valuable insight in examining the ramifications of the CHIPS Act. In conclusion, this article presents a fine-tuned viewpoint on the intersection of legislative endeavors and technological advancements in the semiconductor industry, thereby contributing to a deeper comprehension of the intricate interplay between policy frameworks and disruptive innovation.",
    "conclusion": "China’s prevailing initiative is to establish an effective way to use lithographs based on multiple patterning skills.651 At the same time, China is actively exploring a novel light source for lithography machines, integrating particle accelerators and SSMB technologies.652 This adoption of technologies, of multiple patterning and particle accelerators, has the potential to reconfigure the competition in the global semiconductor industry substantively.653 China’s strategic objective is to domesticate the manufacturing of chips, thereby mitigating dependencies on foreign technological entities.654 Central to this pursuit is the aspiration to assume a preeminent position in the semiconductor fabrication process, particularly in cutting-edge technologies such as 2nm chip manufacturing.655 Both the CHIPS Act and the EU Chips Act are important pieces of legislation that aim to strengthen the semiconductor industries of the U.S. and the EU.656 On a comparative basis, the CHIPS Act in the U.S. provides more funding than the European Chips Act and has a stronger focus on manufacturing.657 The EU Chips Act, on the other hand, has a stronger focus on research and development, emphasizing collaborative international efforts and innovative technologies.658 Both acts also differ in their approach to particle accelerator technology.659 The CHIPS Act does not mention particle accelerator technology but provides semiconductor research and development funding. The EU Chips Act, on the other hand, specifically mentions particle accelerator technology and its potential to revolutionize chip manufacturing.661 To support the development of new semiconductor technologies and to invest in research and development to improve the efficiency and sustainability of the global semiconductor supply chain, the U.S. and the EU should work together to develop and implement global semiconductor supply chain security standards. This would help to protect the global semiconductor supply chain from cyberattacks and other threats.662 By incorporating the recommendations as stipulated in this article, the U.S. and the EU can strengthen their semiconductor industries and reduce their reliance on foreign suppliers to some extent. This will help to ensure that they remain at the forefront of semiconductor technology and that they can develop and deploy the products and services of the future",

    "abstract": "As the most carbon-intensive source of electricity, coal-fired power gener- ation is incompatible with international climate change mitigation efforts. The international community therefore agreed to transition away from coal to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 and remain within the temperature limits set under international law. However, phasing out existing coal power stations can conflict with international investment protection treaties. Recent arbitration claims against the United States, Canada, and European coun- tries show how foreign investors can challenge climate measures before international tribunals and threaten to paralyze the ambitious actions needed to address climate change. As a key financier of coal power infrastructure, China plays a crucial role in the global transition away from coal. Besides China's domestic reliance on coal, its companies have heavily invested in coal power overseas, particularly in Asia. Taking into account the threat of investment arbitration to climate reg- ulation, a crucial question therefore is whether foreign investors, for example from China, could slow down Asia's energy transition by challenging coal phase-out decisions before international arbitration?",
    "conclusion": "Given China's role in overseas coal power investments and the risk of invest- ment arbitration facing phase-out decisions, China's position on the tension between investment protection and climate regulation is relevant for the global transition away from coal. Major hosts of Chinese coal power investments have announced their intention to phase down coal power on their territory, but the requirement to compensate investors for these stranded assets could jeopardize the implementation of these decisions. In theory, Chinese investment treaties provide legal grounds to investors to seek, and potentially obtain, significant damages for the closure of their installations. Following the international trend, China included environmental exceptions in its recent investment treaties. However, arbitral practice on these exceptions has shown limits to their effectiveness in safeguarding states' regulatory powers. Although there are strong arguments for host states to justify ambitious climate regulation under international investment law, the unpredictable interpretation and application of investment treaties by arbitral tribunals exposes states to sizeable financial risks. Given the difficulty in formulating effective exceptions protecting states' regu- latory powers to adopt climate measures, alternative approaches to facilitate the transition away from coal are needed. First, building on the recent attempt to modernize the Energy Charter Treaty, China and its partners could incorporate a coal power, or fossil fuel, carve-out in their investment treaties, thereby allowing host states to exclude investment protection for coal power after a ten-year transi- tion period. Second, China could help prevent arbitration claims against phase- out decisions by requiring Chinese investors to strictly comply with the climate laws of the states where they invest. This approach is already recognized under China's existing environmental regulation of overseas investments. To address the threat of arbitration to coal phase out, the \"host country\" principle could now be established as a binding requirement to be enforced by the government. In sum, tackling foreign investors' global carbon footprint while preventing the threat of investment arbitration does not only depend on sound investment treaty reforms, but also on the home state's domestic regulation of its overseas investments. Not only the host state, but also the home state government has a role to play in facilitating the energy transition of its investment partners, and thereby catalyzing further urgent fossil phase-out initiatives mired by the investment-climate tension.",

    "conclusion": "The coronavirus pandemic has no doubt accelerated the arrival of this machinedominated era where human governance succumbs to algorithmic rules. “I had believed that the days when we, as humans, would be governed by machines and algorithms was supposed to be at least half a century away. However, the sudden outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated its arrival… with a health red code issued by big data and machines,” wrote by a blogger on China’s popular knowledge-exchange forum Zhihu.216 In an act of self-irony, the blogger described himself as “a red code holder under the tyranny of big data and machines” and expressed his helplessness and frustration, like many others, who had no option but to “wait for machines to grant me freedom.”217 We stand at a historical juncture when surveillance has never before exerted such a “lightweight” yet profoundly and pervasive impact over every aspect of human existence, spanning from the physical to the mental realms, as it does today. China’s health QR codes is a pioneering tool which signals this ambitious fusion between the dictates of political authority and the power of algorithms. Contrary to the assumption that biometric surveillance enabled by big data and AI has vanished from the post-pandemic life is ample evidence that the coded control of health QR codes continues to offer a subtle art of sanction. This article critically examines China’s health QR code system against the fragmented and deficient legal-regulatory framework governing its operation and the ethical tenets that define the moral responsibilities of data processors. While the pandemic's exigencies spurred rapid adoption of these nascent systems without rigorous safeguards, their persistence after the pandemic has been enabled by a concerted collaboration between state and tech powers as well and legitimized by an ideological commitment to safeguard collective security. As such, China’s pandemic responses prioritize public health over individual liberties and privacy, and political as well commercial interests over personal rights, thereby resulting in a state-industry dominance model of pandemic governance, in contrast to the rights-oriented approach adopted by Western democracies. This explains why China’s legal system plays such a limited role in reshaping the dynamics and balance between power, technology, and individual rights. The COVID-19 pandemic underscores advanced technology's capacity to either empower or subordinate humanity - depending on whether its arc bends toward justice. The interplay between technology and ethical accountability prompts a fascinating inquiry: Is it the innovation of technology that diminishes our sense of responsibility, or is it an inherent desire to evade moral duty that spurs the adoption of emerging technologies? This present study suggests that the real problem, perhaps, is not whether surveillance technology diminishes our autonomy, privacy and rights. Rather, it is the desire, political and commercial, to be relieved of moral responsibility that drives the adoption and perpetuation of new technology.",

    "conclusion": "Our analysis of the 103 exonerated capital cases reveals that the confession rate was high, torture was rampant, and the police were primarily motivated by the goal of finality, not truth-finding. One baseline assumption is that the police use necessary means, including the use of torture to extract confessions, to get to the bottom of the truth so that criminals are punished. Despite being cruel, illegal, and possibly yielding false confessions, the use of torture may be justified for the truth-finding purpose. However, when the police know they do not have sufficient evidence (even with one’s confession), yet decide to alter and/or fabricate evidence, or to hide exculpatory evidence from the prosecutor and the judge, their primary goal is no longer for truth-finding, but achieving finality. In other words, when police tamper with evidence, they no longer care about the truth (e.g., whether the accused was the one who committed the crime), but merely aim to close the case. Our data showed, in approximately three-fourths of these exonerated death penalty cases, police tampered with evidence, and this pattern holds true across different eras. After decades of legal reforms, unfortunately, the Chinese criminal justice system remains crime control oriented, inquisitorial in nature, albeit the defense is slowly gaining some power. Readers must be cautioned that our samples involved only exonerated capital cases, which may expose police abuse in its worst forms. Our analysis nevertheless sheds light on some of the fundamental issues faced by the Chinese criminal justice system. If these high-profile death penalty cases had difficulties in having their errors detected and corrected, it would have been worse for relatively minor cases which would have more difficulty to have their grievances heard. Major implications for relevant confession laws and practices are summarized below. First, effective measures should be taken to curb heavy reliance on confession as sole or primary evidence in conviction. The current CPL made it clear that confession evidence alone is insufficient for conviction (Article 55). To reduce police incentives in obtaining confessions at all costs, several improvements should be made, including (1) the law should exclude illegally collected evidence that would otherwise not be discoverable, regardless of whether the evidence is corroborated or not (in contrast, under the current exclusionary rule, illegal obtained physical evidence may still be used so long as they are verified or justified, Article 55); and (2) evidentiary chain must be established and rigorously contested. This requires that police officers have the competence and skills to collect, analyze, and present evidence, police departments have sufficient resources for equipment and testing, and the defense has access to full evidentiary files and independent forensic experts. In She Xianglin case, for example, She requested the police perform DNA tests on the dead body, who was mistakenly identified as his missing wife. The police replied that “DNA testing was too expensive, who would pay for it?” (Li, 2015:1). At the same time, it should be pointed out that scientific tests could contain errors and are subject to human interpretations. In Nian Bin case, for example, but for the defense’s ability to hire their own forensic experts to challenge the state’s forensic test results, Nian would not have been exonerated (Li, 2015). Second, the use of torture should be prevented, detected, and punished. Currently, torture resulting in physical injury or death carries criminal liability, and the burden of proof lies with the accused who must undergo a physical examination by the state-designated hospitals, which could raise issues about the credibility of the test results. Instead, the burden should be reversed and fall on the police to prove no torture (Chen, 2006). In addition, a review for potential torture should be activated when during an interrogation; there is a death non-self-inflicted bodily injury, excessive length of detention, or a failure to notify family and lawyers about one’s detention and interrogation (He, 2009). Furthermore, our data showed that interrogations were overwhelmingly conducted at a local police station or police bureau, and few were recorded and in lawyers’ presence. The current CPL stipulates interrogations be conducted at a detention center after a suspect was sent to the detention center, and the suspect is entitled to hire a lawyer at the first interrogation session or on the first day in police custody, and interrogation of major (including life or death penalty cases) cases be recorded in its entirety (Articles 118, 34, 123). The CPL also stipulated that the legal aid office may appoint in-house counsel at local courts and detention centers to provide legal service to criminal suspects (Article 36). We suggest that over time, every detention center should have in-house counsel service, and interrogation sessions must be recorded with a lawyer present who signs off the recording as part of the case record. Granted, it would involve high costs and logistics that could take years to materialize. Chen (2006) further suggested restructuring detention centers as independent unit housed under the Department of Justice instead of the public security bureaus to ensure the integrity of an interrogation. More importantly, claims of police abuse must be allowed to go through a more formalized procedure and be examined by an independent judiciary. It is expected to see the extremely high confession rate and torture in our samples because they involve wrongfully convicted death penalty cases. Nevertheless, there is a general consensus among China legal scholars that police torture is widespread and coerced confession rate is rather high even among non-capital, ordinary cases (Bi, 2007; Zuo, 2005). Wu and Vander Beken (2010) attributed the high rates in torture and confession to a number of factors, including political (e.g., crime fighting as a political mandate), cultural (e.g., the influence of Confucianism and communitarianism), legal (e.g., lack of procedural safeguards in preventing police abuse such as the presence of legal counsel during interrogations, and one’s right to remain silent), and institutional reasons (e.g., low police budget, high workload and pressure, lack of competence and technology, lack of transparency and checks and balances). Tackling so many factors simultaneously is not an easy task. Third, an effective error correction system should be established. The existing accountability system seems to suffer a dilemma: on the one hand, it seems to focus heavily on finding individual faults, rather than improving the system’s integrity, thus reducing stakeholders’ incentives of self-corrections (as evident in the Nie Shubin case). On the other hand, once an error was discovered, the punishment was seemingly allocated haphazardly and indiscriminately (as seen in Huugjilt’s case), and it was unclear what specific action was sanctioned and how responsibilities/punishment were assessed and determined. The Nian Bin case is another example here: besides the chief police officer who used torture and was blamed as the main culprit for Nian’s wrongful conviction, none of the prosecutors, forensic experts, or lower court judges was assessed of their responsibilities in mishandling the case, and no other related personnel was sanctioned. In addition, in reviewing these cases, we could not identify clear procedural rules regarding the petition and review process for those who protest wrongful convictions; and the review process took years and often witnessed unexpected twists and turns depending on the players involved. Indeed, our data showed that only 20% of the police officers with misconduct received any punishment, and few upper echelon officials received meaningful sanctions. In terms of identifying systemic flaws and proposing steps to curb similar mistakes in the future, few concrete actions were derived from these tragic errors, albeit progress has been made with amendments in the CPL over the years. We suggest that error detection and correction mechanisms focus primarily on systemic errors to improve the system and prevent future errors, instead of finding individual faults. When individuals violate the law, they should have due process protections and be given an opportunity to explain and defend their actions. Only with a fair process and proper goals would legal officers have the incentives to identify and correct errors, rather than covering them up. Granted, in instances of intentional, serious violations of laws, officers should be held accountable for their actions, but the details of their actions and laws applied must be clearly stipulated to establish transparency and credibility. Only under these circumstances is it likely that individual law enforcement officers would operate professionally, with dignity and courage to make the best decisions. Last but not the least, law enforcement works shall be independent of political and populous demand and pressure. A political mandate such as “all murders must be solved” goes against the science of criminal investigation and raises unfulfillable expectations of the victim’s family. Worse yet, by directly linking police rewards and promotion with crime clearance rate, it may make the police chase the wrong goals. After all, the goals of truth-finding and finality operating under a crime control model may not always be in harmony. When they are not, the Chinese legal reformers must contemplate upon which one should be given the priority. Within this context, a larger question perhaps is whether the ultimate truth can be discovered in all cases? If not, how to ensure stakeholders accept the less satisfying or un-satisfying outcome? As seen in some of the exonerated cases in our data, victim’s families were not happy with the exonerations. While we propose these suggestions from the perspective of incremental, institutional reforms guided by science and empirical evidence, we recognize that these changes are necessarily intertwined, and an attempt to address one (e.g., curbing a heavy reliance on confession) without addressing the others (e.g., establishing a more effective error correction system) might not work. Moreover, calling for a complete removal of political and popular influence over the police work may not be realistic; after all, the mandate for the police is to provide public safety and its policy ought to reflect political and popular demand. Nevertheless, in handling criminal investigations, police must be guided by science, not by external influences. To what extent an authoritarian state tolerates a less impressive crime fighting record as it adjusts policies of its criminal justice system resides in its mutual understanding and trust with the people. The Chinese death penalty reforms have certainly made great strides in the past two decades with the establishment of various procedural safeguards (e.g., Liang & Lu, 2016). Our study suggests that more legal and administrative protections should be afforded to capital offenders due to the irreversibility of wrongful convictions and executions in death penalty cases. Towards that goal, laws shall be explicit in affording criminal suspects the right to remain silent (the current CPL requires the suspect to truthfully answer the police questions, Article 120) to avoid self-incrimination (Article 52). This is crucial, especially given the long-standing cultural tradition that makes it a default choice for defendants to admit (confess) guilt in exchange for lenient dispositions. Despite the overwhelming practice of torture among wrongful conviction cases in this study, case details seemed to suggest that without physical and/or psychological torture/coercion, many of these defendants would not have admitted guilt. Based on the experiences of Western countries, however, a seemingly rational decision, free from physical or psychological torture/coercion, may also lead innocent defendants to admit guilt (e.g., in the context of plea bargains). An additional safeguard for death penalty cases is, when resources permit, an automatic review of all capital offenders who confessed to their crimes, and the state shall bear the burden of proof of no use of torture to ensure the voluntariness and reliability of one’s confession, regardless of whether a claim of torture is made or not.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Legal order originated in a land-centered agricultural society, having now gone through a market-centered industrial society and a network-centered information society. With the rise of the intelligent society, it is transforming into an algorithm- centered legal order of an intelligent society. The \"digital\" \"networking\" \"intelligent\" revolution brought by the intelligent technologies including big data, cloud computing, the Internet, blockchain, and artificial intelligence (AI), has been causing critical challenges to the current legal order, and has generated powerful momentum for construction of fresh legal order featuring scientificness, people centeredness, justice, inclusiveness and co-governance. Construction of such a new jurisprudential legal order to solve this intelligent society's \"governance deficit\" is an urgent task. There is a need to set up a new foundation on which an intelligent society can build steady and lasting progress.",
    "conclusion": "An intelligent society comes soon enough and highlights the urgent nature of \"constructing legal order\" for this intelligent society. This construction is a scientific proposition, a theme of the times, and a research topic. We must guide and regulate the intelligent technology revolution with rationality, virtue and strength of the rule-of-law, make the intelligent system safer and more controllable, and make its technical application more ethical and rational, so that the intelligent system can become the productivity basis for promoting the well-regulated, sharing, equitable and harmonious social development. Only when we have reasonable and sufficient expectations for our privacy protection, peace in life and freedom of mind, can we really get fair rules, fair rights and fair opportunities relating to algorithm decision-making and machine decisionmaking. Only when scientificness, human-centeredness, justice, inclusiveness and cogovernance are listed as core elements of jurisprudential order, can intelligent online education, intelligent telemedicine, intelligent barrier-free facilities, remote legal services, intelligent social governance and internet justice play positive roles. It is these roles that unleash positive energy, help narrow the economic gap between people, reduce regional imbalance and make up for the current situation of insufficient supply and uneven sharing of all kinds of high-quality resources. We will better realize digital justice, educational equity, medical equity, judicial equity, and public services equality, and better safeguard the rights and interests of socially vulnerable groups such as the ill, the elderly, the disabled, the wounded, and the poor, so that all people can share the fruits of technological development under the legal order of the intelligent society, and realize the all-round development of people and social progress.

    "conclusion": "Party-state birth planning authorities are not the only forces constraining women’s reproductive autonomy in contemporary China. Likewise, law and courts are not irrelevant to regulating abortion in China. Men seek to control women’s reproductive autonomy and use the courts to do so. Chinese courts have not only served as unexpected fora for contesting reproduction, but have also played an indirect role in regulating abortion by ignoring, legitimizing, and occasionally rewarding men's claims. Our findings paint a picture of how persistent male claims to control women's reproduction can be, how and why women and their lawyers often fail to raise legal objections to such claims, and how legal institutions often bend or ignore the law in favor of deep-rooted cultural norms. As China emerges from an era in which the state coercively administered contraception, sterilization, and abortion, the relaxation of birth regulation does not necessarily equate to greater freedom for women. In addition, as the Chinese Party-state increasingly embraces pro-birth policies, the Party- state seems likely to rely on a combination of cultural norms and private law enforcement to achieve its new goals of restricting abortion and encouraging births. Scholars working across a range of jurisdictions should be attuned to how legal systems create space for and reinforce men's claims to control women's reproductive choices, even when the right to abortion is clear and well-established in law. In particular, scholars should consider how routine private law lawsuits can become sites where reproductive rights are either fulfilled or denied, how rights can be weaponized to serve regressive goals, and the extent to which political regime type affects how and where a state regulates abortion. The U.S. Supreme Court's ruling in Dobbs has reignited and reshaped global conversation regarding reproductive rights. China's recent experiences demonstrate that there is much to learn from looking beyond frameworks that assume a clear divide between authoritarian and liberal systems when it comes to regulating abortion. Viewing how abortion is contested in China's courts reveals what is at the core of litigation over reproductive rights: a struggle between men and women to control women's bodies, one in which the participants regularly search for new modes of legal expression.",

    "abstract": "Since the introduction of the Internet, China's networked public sphere has become a critical site in which various actors compete to shape public opinion and promote or forestall legal and political change. This paper examines how members of an online public, the Tianya Forum, concep- tualized and discussed law in relation to a specific event, the 2008 Sanlu milk scandal. Whereas previous studies suggest the Chinese state effec- tively controls citizens' legal consciousness via propaganda, this analysis shows that the construction of legality by the Tianya public was not a top- down process, but a complex negotiation involving multiple parties. The Chinese state had to compete with lawyers and outspoken media to frame and interpret the scandal for the Tianya public and it was not always successful in doing so. Data show further how the online public framed the food safety incident as indicative of fundamental problems rooted in China's political regime and critiqued the state's instrumental use of law.",
    "conclusion": "Literature on legality and legal consciousness suggests that the Chinese state controls the construction of legality via state propaganda, and is able to shape citizens’ legal consciousness given most people’s lack of direct experience with the law. (Gallagher 2006; Liebman 2011a: 183; Michelson and Read 2011, Stockmann and Gallagher 2011; Su and He 2010: 163). Our findings, however, suggest that the construction of legality is not a top-down process wholly controlled by the authoritarian state, but rather a complex negotiation involving multiple parties. Participants in Tianya were unconvinced by and openly critical of official state discourse. The participants’ exposure to the voices of volunteer lawyers, NGOs, parents of victims-mainly through the mediation of relatively outspoken newspapers and online news websites-as well as their own discussions in Tianya influenced how they constructed problems associated with the Sanlu scandal and legality. As our analysis has shown, the Party-state’s official discourse constructed problems narrowly, downplaying the Sanlu scandal as simply a food safety incident. The legality constructed in official discourse is a top-down and paternalistic order carefully orchestrated by the Party-state. According to this narrative, the benevolent state knows exactly what the problems are and what is best for citizens. It uses law to tackle food safety problems, punish wrongdoers, and protect citizens, while also improving legal norms and institutions to make them better instruments for governance. Under such legality, the purpose of law is to create the kind of order desirable for the state. What is missing from the official discourse, however, is any kind of participatory role for non-state actors, such as citizens and lawyers, to help shape legal norms, choose the kind of legal institutions they want to use, and oversee the implementation of law. The underlying message of the official discourse is that citizens and lawyers’ nonorchestrated participation in the legal system could undermine social stability, especially in a crisis situation. Our analysis also finds that the Chinese state attempted to defend China’s legal system vis-a-vis alternative models by developing the concept of “rule of law with Chinese characteristics”-a concept later derisively appropriated and reframed by Tianya participants. Consistent with what scholars call “authoritarian rule of law” (Rajah 2012), “rule by law” (Ginsburg and Moustafa 2008), or “a thin theory of rule of law” (Peerenboom 2002: 3), the legality that emerged in the official discourse stressed the formal and instrumental aspects of law and argued that the government is above the law. Although citizens’ rights do exist, their fulfillment ultimately depends on the consent of the state as, ultimately, the law is a tool in the government’s hands.",

    "abstract": "However, despite appearances of China becoming more legalistic under Xi's leadership, this article argues that the decline in legal rationality reflects not only an increase in arbitrary political suppression but also a rise *109 in arbitrariness within the routine legal system. There are at least two explanations for this decline. First, in an authoritarian system, officials tend to exercise arbitrary power as a convenient means to not only exert political control but also address governance issues --- they may benefit personally from such actions as well. Second, China's partial legal rationality has been mainly maintained through self-restraint by the Communist Party in the post-Mao era. As this self-restraint weakens, both political and non-political spheres are increasingly vulnerable to arbitrary power of dominant officials.",
    "conclusion": "No Conclusion but the final section is: Lessons from Continued Systemic Failures In this study, we focused on systemic failures reflected in the Cui Ning case and four contemporary cases and emphasized the continuation of such failures despite passage of time. Before we draw some lessons, we’d like to point out two caveats. First, the four selected cases are not an anomaly of China’s modern practice. Problems identified in these cases typified cases in the 1980s and 1990s, and these problems continued among cases exposed in the new century (e.g., Zhang Yuhuan). For instance, after four death sentences in eight years, Nian Bin was acquitted in 2014 for an alleged double-murder in 2006. All systemic failures discussed were readily evident in Nian’s case (Lu et al., 2019). Second, as Jiang (2016b, 300-301) pointed out, China’s law and practice tend to define the scope of wrongful convictions narrowly (limited to errors in facts or in convictions). Plus the extreme difficulty in proving wrongful convictions short of windfalls, these exposed cases represent the tip of an iceberg. This study contributes to our understanding of China’s wrongful conviction in two ways: first, it adds to a small body of English literature on this topic, which would allow access to overseas audience. Second, albeit these systemic failures in contemporary cases have been well documented in the last two decades, our effort to match these failures with that of the Cui Ning case from hundreds of years ago is novel, which makes us reflect upon the continuation of these failures. The attempt to connect the disjunction between studies of historical and contemporary wrongful conviction cases, we contend, deserves more academic and practical attention through domestic and international comparisons. To draw critical lessons, it is helpful to examine the continuation from two angles, from efforts within China and from an international comparison. Within China, it should be acknowledged that China has made significant progress in the past four decades to improve its criminal justice system. Since their inception in 1979, the Criminal Law has already been amended eleven times (the latest in 2020) and the CPL three times (the latest in 2018). Facing challenge of wrongful convictions in particular, a series of laws and regulations have been adopted to tackle problems exposed. In 2010, for example, two new evidence rules were jointly issued by five government branches, including the “Rules on Certain Issues Relating to Examining and Judging Evidence in Death Penalty Cases” and “Rules on Certain Issues Relating to the Exclusion of Illegal Evidence in Criminal Cases.” Hailed as “the exclusionary rule,” they were integrated into the amended CPL in 2012. In 2013, guidelines and provisions regarding prevention of wrongful convictions were adopted by the Central Committee of the CCP and other criminal justice branches to emphasize presumption of innocence and establish mechanisms that potentially curb wrongful convictions (Xiong & Miao, 2018). Some measures to correct wrongful convictions in individual cases such as the change of venue to allow the retrial of Nie’s case were also acclaimed as breakthroughs (Fang & Li, 2017). Additionally, Chinese legal scholars called for more drastic measures such as the right to remain silent, presence of lawyers during police interrogation, and more effective exclusionary rules (He & He, 2008; Jiang, 2014). Nevertheless, serious doubts still exist on the effectiveness of these reform measures for two primary reasons. First, being compromised by concerns about crime control, many of the adopted measures are incomplete and insufficient to counter systemic failures (Jiang, 2015, 2018). For instance, the adopted exclusionary rule leaves ample room for the authorities to admit physical and documentary evidence obtained by illegal means such as torture (Chen, 2011; Lewis, 2011). Second, in practice, the police still “find ways” to circumvent legal stipulations. In the Nian Bin case, the police managed to edit the recording tape and showed “flawless” interrogation in court, despite the requirement that interrogation be audio or video-recorded in its entirety (Lu et al., 2019). Indeed, the recordings of interrogations are often utilized by the police to counter torture claims by criminal suspects/defendants, and even as a tool for hiding or encouraging torture (Jiang, 2018). As shown, wrongful conviction in China is very convoluted and its dominant features continued despite modernization of China’s criminal justice system. The cultural and traditional notion of presumption of guilt, tolerance of use of torture, the public’s willingness to intervene and influence the outcome of individual cases, lack of effective criminal defense, and lack of checks and balances among the gong-jian-fa all play a role and aggravate the problems. It is the “hard-to-change” nature of the Chinese wrongful convictions that presents the most challenge in our opinion. While to fully account for such continuation of systemic failures is complicated and warrants more scholarly attention, we suggest that at least two potential directions, inter-related, should be explored. First, we argue that there lacked fundamental changes to China’s criminal litigation model. Despite passage of time and a modernized system, a criminal justice system driven by predominantly a crime control model with insufficient due process protections and poor mechanisms of checks and balances (e.g., weak criminal defense, the assembly-line workstyle of the gong-jian-fa) is likely to be error-prone, especially when institutional and political pressure and incentives are set to capture criminals by all means and appease the masses. Second, the functioning of the criminal justice system needs to be examined under the influence of China’s political and cultural context. For instance, Xia (2011) explored from a philosophical perspective why torture remains acceptable to many people (including authorities such as the police) in China despite the fact that it has been outlawed. Xia argued that it is utilitarianism culturally and politically embraced by the government and the masses that justifies the use of torture against the bad people (or as a small sacrifice in case of the innocent) for the greater public goods. Thus, despite the official calls to balance “fighting crimes” and “protecting human rights,” the balance is always tipped toward the former. In his study of legal and political rights advocacy in wrongful conviction cases, Jiang (2016a) echoed Xia’s argument and extended it to China’s political system. As Jiang argued, when torture and wrongful conviction cases are exposed, the authorities would tolerate such discussions as long as these problems are portrayed as merely individual, which justifies calling for more supervision and stricter disciplinary mechanisms to eradicate the bad apples of the gong-jian-fa. However, when the legal advocacy for correcting wrongful conviction cases expands and turns into a fight against institutional faults and calls for more citizens’ rights, it poses a potential threat to the government’s authoritarian rule and control based on utilitarianism. Such progressive advocacy is very unlikely to be incorporated in the government initiated, top-down reforms and could even face persecutions. More future study is necessary to examine the influence of China’s polity (authoritarian in nature with little change) and culture (e.g., utilitarianism, paternalism) on the criminal justice system and its practice. An international comparative perspective also sheds invaluable light. On the one hand, scholars showed that many causes of China’s wrongful convictions are similar to that of other nations such as police misconduct, torture, false confession, false witness testimony, and false expert testimony (He, 2016; Huang, 2012; Jiang, 2016b) and China’s use of torture was comparable to the American experience in the 1920s and 1930s (Belkin, 2011). Nevertheless, we argue that these comparisons often failed to take into consideration fundamental features of China’s case that refused to change overtime. Under the surface of common causes lie some unique Chinese “characteristics” that lay the foundation for systemic failures of the Chinese criminal justice system (He, 2014b). For instance, besides common contributing factors to wrongful convictions, Zhong and Dai (2019) emphasized “political factors” unique to the Chinese system such as political pressure to solve cases, intervention by one’s superiors, “strike-hard” campaigns, the assembly line working relationship among the gong-jian-fa, and the influence from the public opinion. Though China’s problems paralleled America’s in the 1920s and 1930s, the American criminal justice system witnessed fundamental transformation in the second half of the twentieth century, but China’s systemic failures continued after hundreds of years. Again, more serious efforts to examine the historical changes (or lack thereof) regarding wrongful conviction within a nation or comparatively would be welcomed. For China to move forward, the tasks are daunting. At the macro level, efforts aimed at fundamental systemic changes should be made toward transforming both the criminal justice system and the general legal system. For the former, more due process protections should be provided to criminal suspects/defendants, and the current dominant inquisitorial crime control model should be balanced with sufficient adversarial and due process components. Note that China has not yet ratified the United Nations International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, though it has ratified the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (Belkin, 2011). Raising the bar to meet the international standards would be a good first step toward such a transformation. For the latter, building a true “rule of law” system would help judicial independence and curb extra-legal influence and interference, a tall order given China’s political-legal system. At the micro level, many specific measures have been proposed to (1) strengthen defense rights, (2) adjust the assembly line working relationship among the gong-jian-fa, and (3) curb extra-legal interventions in the inner workings of the gong-jian-fa. First, to prevent torture and illegal interrogation, scholars have proposed one’s right to remain silent and presence of defense lawyers during police interrogation (Chen, 2005; Zuo, 2016). More defense rights should be granted to elevate the status of criminal defense to counter the dominant police and procuratorate. Without effective defense, it is extremely difficult to prevent presumption of guilt and use of torture by the police. Second, measures should be made to avoid “nominalization” of trials (He, 2016) and courts should be decoupled from the police and procuratorate. The iron-triangle of the gong-jian-fa should be adjusted to be the gong-jian-lü (lawyers) under the supervision of the court, so that judges can independently review evidence and arguments provided by both sides in trials. As long as Chinese courts are structurally embedded in the gong-jian-fa system, the odds are that they would be submissive to the dominance of the police and procuratorate, and judges would be pressured to mete out more lenient punishment when evidence is “insufficient for a conviction.” Third, extra-legal interventions, either administratively within the gong-jian-fa system or politically from any superior government or Party branches or personnel, must be stopped. As seen, political mandates such as “strike-hard” campaigns and “homicide cases must be solved” could lead to havoc to the workings of the gong-jian-fa. As noted (Jiang, 2016b; Lewis, 2011), China’s near 100% conviction rate is not normal nor necessary. When work performance evaluations are administratively set to pressure the police to pursue a high case clearance rate, the procuratorate to pursue a low acquittal rate, and the court to pursue a low reversal/remand rate, incentives are all geared toward crime control at the sacrifice of (already limited) due process protections. Moreover, when the accountability system is mainly utilized as a means to appease the masses, it could be overly expansive (e.g., one police officer who was investigated after She’s exoneration committed suicide under pressure, see Li, 2015) and counter-productive (when incentives are to cover up, instead of correct, one’s errors). Needless to say, direct intervention in individual cases by political-legal committees must end, as it only aggravates the known problem of “decision first and trial second” by Chinese courts (Liang, 2008; He, 2014b). It should be evident that these proposals at the micro and macro levels are interrelated. Reform progress in recent years showed China’s willingness to adopt some piecemeal measures at the micro level. Whether more fundamental changes are going to happen remains to be seen. Without fundamental changes, systemic failures witnessed in this study are likely to continue (hopefully not for hundreds of more years).",

    "abstract": "How should patent legislative power be allocated between central and local governments in order to construct a patent system conducive to promoting innovation? A comparative analysis of the models of the U.S. and China sheds light on this question. The early American states established their patent systems before the formation of the federal system, but the U.S. Constitution arrogated patent legislative power to the federal government, ending the era of decentralized patent systems. This centralized structure ensures uniformity in rules but might binder the system's adaptability and ability to experiment. In contrast, as China's patent system evolved, its patent legislative power spread from the central to the local governments. This shift led to the coexistence of dual-level patent legislative structure. Currently, twenty-nine out of thirty- one province-level authorities (93.5%) and twenty-one out of 323 city-level authorities with local Legislative power (6.5%) have established local patent laws. China's patent system is not entirely decentralized but rather, semi-decentralized, as the locales not only implement their local patent laws but also must enforce the central government's national patent laws. China's semi- decentralized patent legislation model embodies significant features of cooperative federalism, where the central and local governments share the national power to handle affairs and collaborate to address issues. Yet, the central government maintains a dominant position in this cooperative relationship, as a consequence of China's unitary state structure. Compared to the current centralized patent legislation model in the U.S., China's semi-decentralized patent legislation model has the advantage of making statutory law more adaptable to local specificities and promoting local competition and institutional innovation. However, it also faces challenges, such as increased costs due to inconsistency; efficiency decline stemming from rent-seeking behaviors; and the risk that local protectionism will create anti-competitive effects.",
    "conclusion": "This Article compares the patent legislative power allocation models in China and the U.S. In terms of evolutionary paths, the U.S. transitioned from a decentralized model where patent legislative power resided with the states, to a centralized model which consolidated this power at the federal level. Within the realm of patent legislation, there is no collaboration between the federal and state governments. Conversely, China moved from a centralized model, where patent legislative power was concentrated in the central government, to a semi- decentralized model, with coexistence between the patent legislative power of the central and local governments. This Article posits that China's semi-decentralized patent legislation model manifests key elements of cooperative federalism, embodying power sharing between central and local governments as they collaboratively address issues related to innovation. However, the nature of the cooperation between China's central and local governments is distinctive. Unlike the U.S. federal system, where states enjoy significant autonomy, China's central government assumes a dominant role, a consequence of its unitary state structure. Local governments supplement the central government's constructed system by further developing it, tailoring it to local conditions under the central government's guidance and supervision. Compared to the current centralized patent legislation model in the U.S., this Article suggests that the intricate structure of a semi-decentralized patent legislation model might be better equipped to cater to the diverse needs of local industries and inventor communities, and to spur local competition and institutional innovation. It can do this while complying with international treaty requirements, given that national patent laws maintain a level of protection no lower than these treaties necessitate and that local patent laws do not decrease the protection level of the national laws. However, the model also faces challenges regarding potential inconsistency, rent-seeking behaviors, and local protectionism. Chas journal o international tow The examination of this semi-decentralized patent legislation model opens new avenues for understanding legislative diversity, stimulating further scholarly discourse. Beyond introducing a novel case study in intellectual property law within a particular national context, it also offers fresh perspectives on the institutional designs of federal and unitary governments in addressing innovation issues.",

However, the emergence of quality-supporting institutions has not been well studied.

In this study, we aimed to understand the mechanism of the quality-upgrading process. Crises reshape entrepreneurs’ and local governments’ perceptions of the payoffs and costs of quality upgrading. When facing a harsh external environment, the public and private sectors are more likely to take collective action to improve product quality. Using data from 85 industrial clusters in Zhejiang province, we empirically examined the impact of crises on the quality-upgrading process. We found that the number of patents, the number of enterprises with quality certification, and the share of professional and technical staff in the clusters all show a significant increase after a crisis. Therefore, crises imply an opportunity for upgrading product quality in clusters. However, the positive correlation between crises and quality upgrades does not mean that crises would automatically solve all the quality problems. It is only when crises are successfully addressed that they can become a catalyst for institutional change.",

    "abstract": "As the world's second-largest economy, China has become a critical venue for high-profile cross-border insolvency proceedings in recent years. The evolution of China's insolvency law and the pertinent judicial practice, especially its cross-border aspects, remains in infancy. This development underscores the significance of the 2021 Arrangement between Mainland China and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (“Hong Kong SAR”) on cross-border insolvency cooperation (the “2021 Arrangement”). The Arrangement not only caters to the unique demands under the “One Country, Two Systems” policy but also incorporates legal advancements and institutional features from the 1997 United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (“UNCITRAL”) Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency (“MLCBI”) and the 2015 Recast of European Union (“EU”) Regulation on Insolvency Proceedings. Therefore, the 2021 Arrangement signifies a crucial step forward in legal cooperation between Mainland China and Hong Kong SAR, highlighting the expanding legal interconnections between China, Hong Kong SAR, and the international community in the field of cross-border insolvency. However, the judicial practice under the 2021 Arrangement since its enactment, especially its sparse utilization by Mainland judges, suggests that it has not achieved its intended objectives. A variety of factors contribute to the lack of effective and meaningful cooperation. Against this backdrop, the article begins by detailing the Arrangement's foundational principles and key features. It proceeds to analyze the reasons for the Arrangement's failure to significantly improve cooperation between Mainland China and the Hong Kong SAR, including a review of judicial practices to pinpoint inefficiencies and gaps. Furthermore, the article outlines potential strategies to enhance the Arrangement's effectiveness, aiming to remedy its current deficiencies. It explores ways to refine *373 the 2021 Arrangement, emphasizing the need for greater alignment with the UNCITRAL MLCBI, enhancing communication, and technical modifications, among others.",
    "conclusion": "For decades, the dynamic between Mainland China and Hong Kong in addressing cross-border insolvency has been underdeveloped. It is universally acknowledged that forging an effective and efficient partnership in this domain holds the key to nurturing a conducive business environment across both Mainland China and Hong Kong. The establishment of a formal mechanism for mutual recognition and assistance is critical in safeguarding legal interests and mitigating the uncertainties inherent in cross- border insolvency scenarios. With this objective, the 2021 Arrangement has been crafted to refine the cross-border insolvency proceedings, offering a structured approach to bolster cooperation between the two regions. Thus, the Arrangement marks a substantial advancement, playing a vital role in fortifying the market economy and propelling economic growth. Almost three years after the introduction of the 2021 Arrangement, its implementation has been less effective than anticipated, due to factors including its underutilization and communication gaps, among others. Given the closer business ties between Hong Kong and cities in mainland China, it remains to be seen whether the 2021 Arrangement can serve as a useful and practical solution to facilitate more efficient cross-border corporate restructuring actions and expand beyond the three pilot cities to other major cities in mainland China. Looking at successful international cooperation mechanisms, it's evident that there's a pressing need for both jurisdictions to embrace the UNCITRAL MLCBI, improve communication channels, and increase procedural transparency to facilitate more effective cross-border insolvency cooperation. The recommendations proposed in this article aim to overcome existing obstacles and improve the framework for cross- border insolvency cooperation between the two jurisdictions.",

    "abstract": "No abstract. Introduction - In October 2021, LinkedIn announced that it had to exit the Chinese market because it had faced “a significantly more challenging operating environment and greater compliance requirements.”1 Similarly, Yahoo chose to leave China because of an “increasingly challenging business and legal environment,” and terminated its services in China on November 1, 2021, which coincided with the effective date of China's Personal Information Protection Law (PIPL).2 Although neither company specified the exact reason for their departure, the media and scholars have predicted that they chose to leave because of the heightened data localization requirements in China's Cybersecurity Law, Data Security Law (DSL) and PIPL.3 Data localization regulations require certain data to be stored within national borders.4 Although China is not the only country with data localization requirements,5 it receives overwhelming attention because of its authoritarian status and concerning lack of human rights protections. It is not surprising that when speaking of data localization, people may first think it is a method that authoritarian countries use to manipulate their citizens. In fact, data localization, or similar regulations, has been adopted in many countries (as explained below), and many of them are *184 considered relatively liberal. Different countries have distinct rationales for adopting data localization rules. For example, as shown below, countries may impose data localization restrictions to benefit local economies, defend national security, and protect human rights. However, data localization rules are controversial because they can be a double-edged sword. They have destructive potential to damage information security and impede human rights to free access to information and privacy. Interestingly, it seems that no matter how controversial data localization is, countries around the world have trended towards imposing more and more control over data, especially after COVID-19. Therefore, this article is intended to dig deeper into global data localization measures and how data localization policies may be regulated in a global context. The first part of this article will examine the data localization policies adopted around the world and analyze their advantages and received criticisms. Then, the second part of this article introduces the theory that data localization is an unstoppable global trend because of countries' enthusiasm toward data sovereignty and data control. Next, the third part of this article proposes that an intergovernmental organization that sets universal rules of free data flow restrictions and monitors countries' data usage should be established to address authoritarian countries' data abuse. Specifically, the members of the organization should make joining the organization a prerequisite of trade, and the organization should serve as additional jurisdiction for people in authoritarian countries to seek remedies for data exploitation by their governments.",
    "conclusion": "Despite how scholars evaluate data localization, there seems to be an unstoppable trend of “sovereignty fever” in the digital space, which drives countries to impose more restrictions on the free flow of data, including data localization. From the exploration of the data localization restrictions, it is safe to conclude that sometimes countries have legitimate reasons to restrict data flow, especially for cross-border data transfer, even though data localization regulation itself is controversial. Therefore, the most acute issue for data localization is how authoritarian countries can be restrained from exploiting the data they collect. To address this issue, an intergovernmental organization should be established to monitor data usage among countries and provide a neutral platform to resolve disputes related to potential data exploitation.",

    "abstract": "It is well understood that when firms receive favorable treatment from the government because of their political connections and not necessarily their economic merits, they may operate inefficiently while enjoying market advantages over their unconnected peers. However, just how firms respond to the sustained removal of their political connections has not been carefully studied. This article evaluates an unanticipated reform in China that removed government-related personnel from independent directorships of publicly listed companies. Our evidence indicates that treated firms experienced a temporary increase in their cost of debt, but invested more in R&D, imported more machinery, and became more productive and transparent. These adjustments counterbalanced the negative value effect from the financial markets when the regulation was first announced (JEL G38, P26, K20).",
    "conclusion": "It is well documented that political connections have value for firms because they provide government concessions such as favorable regulations, government contracts, and cheap finance and bailouts. However, whether the weakening and removal of these connections encourage and enables firms to adapt and operate more competitively has not been carefully studied. In this article, we use China’s File 18 as a source of exogenous variation in the removal of government-related personnel from the boards of private companies. Consistent with the view that political connections have value, firms with politician-directors lost value around the time that File 18 was announced, and their cost of debt increased a year after its enactment. However, we find evidence that File 18 incentivized connected firms to transform their corporate strategies and operate more competitively. One year after losing their politician-directors, these firms had boosted their productivity, imported more machinery, and operated more transparently: within two years, their cost of debt had recovered; and within three years, they were spending more on R&D. Consistent with the view that these firms were learning to operate more competitively, after three years, their market valuation had bounced back from losses around the time that File 18 was enacted. Stretching somewhat further, our study sheds light on the relationship between anticorruption reforms and economic growth. Clearly, fighting the misuse of political connections is a central component of anticorruption reforms. Our findings suggest that when a reform is part of a broad and credible government commitment to reduce corruption, it is possible to eliminate political connections within private firms and thus stimulate them to rapidly adjust in ways that promote economic growth.",

    "abstract": "China has been making efforts to reduce the number of executions via a recentralized review process under judicial guidelines. This study analyzes 650 Death Sentence Review Transcripts collected from China Judgments Online, aiming to decipher patterns and variations of death review decisions via descriptive facts and circumstances. We find that marital or domestic violence, offender's guilty conscience or forgiveness by victim's family, and insufficient heinousness underline the disapproval patterns. In contrast, large number of victims or victim deaths, use of weapon, brutal crime nature, being a ringleader in violent crimes, and significant drug weight in drug crimes describe the approval patterns with a general lack of recognition for mitigating circumstances. However, significant variations existed among approved cases, involving defendants who caused a single death for domestic or marital dispute, had no criminal record, committed a crime of passion, or carried low-purity drugs or acted as drug mules. These variations raise the question of whether the Supreme People's Court maintains a consistent standard following its own guidelines.",
    "conclusion": "To summarize, this study shows considerable variations among SPC's DSRs, and there is still a long way to go to fulfill the policy of \"killing fewer\" instructed by SPC's official slogan. Note that DSR must be advised by SPC Adjudication Committee in some cases, which we cannot observe from the published TDSRs.49 By any means, the SPC should keep improving the consistency of its decisions and making the use of death sentences more predictable. We caution the reader regarding the lack of generalizability of our data. TDPRs utilized in this study were not complete collections of all death sentenced cases in the related years or from a certain jurisdiction. We also acknowledge the methodological limitations of descriptive analysis due to limitation of data in current reality. More inferential statistical analysis (e.g., multivariate analysis) would be helpful in the [End Page 159] future once more data becomes available. Fully acknowledging these caveats, we argue that the wide range of cases in our sample allows a limited but meaningful analysis of the DSR decision patterns and the extent of their variations, which is not achieved in previous studies, thus our unique contribution to the readership of death sentence in China. We believe that the results of our study shed light on our understanding the DSR process, particularly through analyzing cases that are comparable based on legal factors such as the type of offense, the level of harm, and the background of the offender. The identified deviations from SPC guidelines could be a starting point for review of actual DSR practices and potential policy changes to further calibrate the death sentencing process in China. Given the finding that even elite SPC judges struggled to maintain uniform and consistent standards in DSR, one critical step would be to revise the relevant content of the CL to better guide judicial decisions from meting out death sentences. We hope this study helps inspire further intellectual inquiries and contribute to meaningful policy improvements regarding China's death penalty practice.",

    "abstract": "Survey results inflate political trust in China if the observed trust in the central government is mistaken for the latent trust in the Centre. The target of trust in the country is the Centre, which is ultimately the top leader. The critical issue domain for assessing the Centre's trustworthiness is policy implementation rather than policymaking. The Centre's trustworthiness has two dimensions: commitment to good governance and the capacity to discipline local officials. Observed trust in the central government indicates trust in the Centre's commitment, while observed trust in the local government reflects confidence in the Centre's capacity. A machine learning analysis of a national survey reveals how much conventional reading overestimates political trust. At first glance, 85 per cent of the respondents trust the central government. Upon further inspection, 18 per cent have total trust in the Centre, 34 per cent have partial trust and 33 per cent are sceptical.",
    "conclusion": "This paper proposes a new interpretation of survey findings of trust in government in China. The new measurement scheme treats the observed trust in the central government as an indicator of trust in the Centre’s commitment and treats the observed trust in the local government as a reflection of confidence in the Centre’s capacity. The study shows that the conventional reading of the national survey results considerably overestimates political trust in the authoritarian regime because it mistakes the observed trust in the central government for latent trust in the Centre. It is true that the vast majority of the population trust the central government; however, closer inspection shows that only about one-fifth of the population are confident about the Centre’s commitment and capacity, one-third trust its commitment without the matching confidence about capacity, another third are sceptical about both, and nearly 15 per cent are distrustful of both. For scholars, the finding paves the way for exploring sources and implications of trust in the Centre. For policy analysts, the study suggests an innovative approach to obtaining a more accurate assessment of the authoritarian regime’s “soft power.” The study highlights the importance of contextualization for optimizing conceptual equivalence, which is critical to avoid concept stretching in comparative political studies. Contextualizing a concept involves profiling its genetic structure in light of its specific context of origin. Applying a concept requires matching the genetic profile of a member of the conceptual family in a different setting with that of the prototype. In the comparative study of political trust, the prototype of trust in government can be traced back to John Locke’s social contract theory on the one hand and the practice of representative democracy and the rule of law on the other hand. In a democracy with the rule of law, the target of trust is an elected political institution that is simultaneously responsible for legislation and administration. The critical issue domain is law-making, and the distinction of commitment and capacity applies primarily to individual politicians. The study shows that political trust in China belongs to the family of political trust, but it has distinctive characteristics. National surveys ask people to assess the trustworthiness of the central government, but the invoked target of trust is the ruling party’s central leadership, which is ultimately its “core leader.” The central government is the organizational embodiment of the Centre, but the two are not identical. Since many people assume that the Centre is the master or owner of the country and therefore must be committed to good governance out of its own interest, the critical issue domain for assessing the Centre’s trustworthiness is policy implementation rather than policymaking. Furthermore, since the Centre is ultimately the “core leader,” its trustworthiness has a dimension of commitment and a distinct aspect of capacity. Once contextualized, it is clear that the survey measures of trust in government are valid and reliable, but the survey results require a more nuanced interpretation. Methodologically, the study demonstrates the value of machine learning techniques for analysing complex survey data. In particular, k-means clustering allows researchers to strike a better balance between computational optimization and theoretical validity. Since the results of k-means clustering are indeterministic, researchers can choose a model that conforms with field observation and theoretical expectation without imposing a structure on the data. Moreover, supervised multinomial regression analysis minimizes questionable classifications without compromising the objectivity of the results of k-means clustering. The study also demonstrates the value of using complementary datasets. The comprehensive and detailed local survey provides a solid foundation for identifying representative trust patterns, while the national survey secures the generalizability of findings.",

    "abstract": "This study examines how and when labor control and management leads to collective resistance in China’s food-delivery platform economy. I develop the concept of “platform architecture” to examine the technological, legal, and organizational aspects of control and management in the labor process and the variable relationships between them. Analyzing 68 in-depth interviews, ethnographic data, and 87 cases of strikes and protests, I compare the platform architecture of service and gig platforms and examine the relationship between their respective architecture and labor contention. I argue that specific differences in platform architecture diffuse or heighten collective contention. Within the service platform, technological control and management generates work dissatisfaction, but the legal and organizational dimensions contain grievances and reduce the appeal of, and spaces for, collective contention. Conversely, within the gig platform, all three dimensions of platform architecture reinforce one another, escalating grievances, enhancing the appeal of collective contention, and providing spaces for mobilizing solidarity and collective action. As a result, gig platform couriers are more likely to consider their work relations exploitative and to mobilize contention, despite facing higher barriers to collective action due to the atomization of their work.",
    "conclusion": "This article is among the first attempts to study collective contention in the food-delivery platform economy in China. It joins recent efforts to analyze labor processes and contention in the platform economy (e.g., Tassinari and Maccarrone 2017, 2020). Building on literature that suggests researchers should incorporate data about management’s perspective in analyzing labor processes in the platform economy (Veen et al. 2019), I examined a variety of data, including interviews with workers, management personnel, a lawyer, and an engineer. As such, this article provides a multi-perspective account of how platform companies and their franchisees control and manage the labor process. Specifically, I demonstrated how platform architecture-technological, legal, and organizational dimensions of control and management-influences labor process and critical mechanisms for collective contention. I also showed that when different dimensions of control reinforce each other in escalating grievances and perceived injustice, and increase the appeal of and spaces for collective action, moments of collective action and solidarity are more likely to emerge. Before discussing the contribution of this study, I first address two analytic issues. The first concerns the 87 cases of collective action. As mentioned previously, the data are limited in their exhaustiveness. To strengthen the reliability of my analysis, I examined the 87 cases along with interviews with couriers and management personnel. Results from the three data sources are consistent. Data triangulation thus strengthens the reliability of my findings. The second issue is a partial alternative explanation. As mentioned, some GPCs worked first as SPCs and switched to the gig platform once they became more familiar with their local area. This suggests SPCs and GPCs might have different skill levels or characteristics due to the self-selection process. As shown in Table 1, SPC and GPC interviewees had similar demographic characteristics and prior employment history. Furthermore, after careful examination of the data, I did not find SPCs and GPCs had different capabilities to participate in collective contention. In short, evidence does not support the alternative explanation. This study makes three major contributions. First, it proposes the theoretical concept of platform architecture to capture not only the technological but also the legal and organizational aspects of labor control and management, as well as the relationship among these different dimensions of control. As such, the study deepens extant scholarship that focuses on algorithmic control and management (Goods et al. 2019; Griesbach et al. 2019; Rosenblat 2018; Rosenblat and Stark 2016; Wood et al. 2019) and sheds light on the variable ways these distinct dimensions of control and management operate, interact, and shape the labor process jointly. Second, the study demonstrates and explains emergent collective action and solidarity in an unlikely setting. Recent scholarship suggests work relations under platform economies can be analyzed through the lens of labor process theory (Veen et al. 2019). Although labor process theory is insightful for analyzing control and management, it does not provide a comprehensive framework for analyzing workers’ responses, especially how workers construct and react to grievances. This study contributes to the literature by integrating labor process theory with sociolegal studies and literature on collective action. As such, this theoretical framework can help analyze how the technical, legal, and organizational dimensions of platform architecture shape collective resistance through influencing the construction of grievances, the appeal of collective contention vis-à-vis other responses to grievances, and access to free spaces for collective action. Although work is atomized and workers share neither workspace nor employers within the gig platform (Webster 2016), I show how gig workers mobilize to contest gig platforms. Following literature that suggests we focus on moments of escalation (Atzeni 2009; Fantasia 1988), I demonstrate that when different dimensions of control reinforce each other, moments of escalation are more likely to evolve into moments of collectivism and solidarity. My findings contribute to a more nuanced understanding of the emergence and characteristics of solidarity in the platform economy. Similar to Tassinari and Maccarrone’s (2020) work, I find expressions of solidarity-mostly, as couriers discuss similar grievances against platform companies in relatively free spaces, and subsequently participate in collective action. But I also examine the cross-cutting, uneven, and contested characteristics of such solidarity, which reveal both the potential and the limitations of solidarity. On the one hand, gig couriers working for one platform company can moblize support and solidarity from restaurant owners and couriers working for the other company. Such cross-cutting solidarity has not previously been documented by studies of collective action in the platform economy. I further provide evidence that some solidarity can prompt compromise from gig platform companies. On the other hand, my findings also reveal the uneven and contested nature of solidarity (Beck and Brook 2020; cf. Tassinari and Maccarrone 2020). I uncover variation among gig workers in terms of their solidarity with other workers and involvement in collective action. Indeed, core actors in collective action share strong solidarity and support. Beyond core actors, however, many GPCs are united only by their shared animosity to the platforms. As a result of shared sentiments, potential sanctions, and curiosity, many GPCs showed up at strikes or protest sites, but only as bystanders. Some non-participating gig workers even encountered threats and violence. Third, my finding about the legal design of platforms goes beyond the conventional concern with the employee-versus-independent-contractor classification (Kenney and Zysman 2016; Vallas 2017; Veen et al. 2019). This study suggests the need to attend to how the enormous difference in contractual power between platforms and couriers intensifies couriers’ sense of injustice and exploitation. As such, it contributes to literature on the role of contractual relationships in the market economy (Suchman 2003). Questions might arise as to why employment classification is not a major concern for couriers in China, considering it is often an important issue in other contexts (Kenney and Zysman 2016). In China, one major difference between workers with and without an employee status is that the former are entitled to social insurance protection according to labor law, but the latter are not. Given the weak enforcement of labor law in China (Gallagher 2017), both SPCs and GPCs understood that employers in the service sector rarely purchase social insurance for workers. Therefore, SPCs did not expect to have social insurance, despite their employee status. Given this absence of a real difference between SPCs and GPCs in terms of social insurance, GPCs were not focused on employment classification. What mattered more in grievance construction was how couriers perceived the predictability and fairness of their legal relationships. Under the service platform, labor contracts help stabilize labor relations. SPCs have clear expectations and feel their employers are constrained by contractual terms and labor law, at least regarding salary. Therefore, SPCs’ injustice and collective action frames only reveal a legal contradiction-the violation of contractual terms or labor law. No one challenges the legitimacy of the legal order based on contracts and labor law. In contrast, under the gig platform, the contractual design enables intense algorithmic control and management by giving platforms unbridled legal and technological power. Legal scholars have been long concerned with the problems associated with “clickwrap agreements” (Hubley 2016; Smith 2016) and asymmetric contracts (Roppo 2009). My analysis shows that when gig platforms exercise their unbridled contractual power to change platform rules, workers not only discern this power but also consider it and the rules made by such power to be “despotic.” Importantly, GPCs can mobilize restaurant owners and GPCs who work for the other gig platform to join collective action because they all suffer alike from asymmetric contractual power and share similar injustice frames. This finding is relevant beyond the Chinese context. As Stewart and Stanford (2017) point out, Uber has a similar contractual design with couriers in Australia. In addition, Uber Eats and Grubhub in the United States have leveraged their market and contractual power to charge restaurants increasing commission fees.7 The Chinese case shows that injustice frames based on asymmetric contractual power can contribute to cross-cutting mobilization and solidarity. Finally, it is important to discuss the generalizability and limitations of this study. This article focused on the labor process. Many of my findings about the relationship between platform architecture and collective resistance can be generalized to other contexts. As I discussed throughout the article, there are many similarities in how gig platforms exercise technological, legal, and organizational control and management acrosscontexts-in China, the United States, Australia, and Europe. Nonetheless, processes and factors beyond the labor process-from state regulation to political regime, trade union activity, differentiation of labor forces, and labor market-can influence labor contention (Burawoy 1985; Collier et al. 2017). To help evaluate the generalizability and limitation of my findings, I specify the following contextual characteristics of the Chinese case. First, the Chinese state has made little effort to restrain monopoly power or initiate antitrust investigations (Huang 2019). In contexts where the state does not fare well in overseeing market power, platform companies can have more unbridled contractual power in strengthening legal and technological control, which could generate a stronger sense of injustice. Second, platform workers do not have high expectations regarding social insurance protection in China. Platform workers in countries where people have higher expectations of job security and social welfare might have different injustice frames. Third, the Chinese case is characterized by its weak civil society, absence of independent labor unions, and authoritarian context-all of which make organizing collective action more restricted. For one thing, gig workers in China focus only on strikes and protests. In contexts where workers have more freedom and assistance from civil society actors and labor unions, collective action could be easier and manifest in various forms. For example, lawyers and civil society actors can help bring institutional changes through influencing the court and regulatory agencies (Collier et al. 2017). Finally, platform workers in China share similar demographic characteristics. In contexts with a large internal division among workers, it might be more difficult for platform workers to organize collective action (Tassinari and Maccarrone 2020). The limitations of this study also point to the need for future research. Efforts should be made to examine how factors beyond the labor process influence platform architecture and its relationship with labor contention.",

      "authorsDataDescription": "I draw on multiple qualitative methods to collect and analyze data. First, I conducted in-depth interviews with 30 SPCs and 30 GPCs in seven cities between 2018 and 2019. I recruited people who were couriers at the time of the interview or in the preceding 12 months. Table 1 shows the distribution of these couriers. At the beginning of the study, I attempted to diversify the interviewee pool according to location, given the possibility of variation across cities in terms of how platforms operate and how couriers work. When it became clear there was no significant difference across cities, I did most of my interviews in Chongqing, a municipality in southwest China, given my access to research support there. Interview questions included basic demographic information, employment history, work situation, interactions with other workers and supervisors, and experiences of strikes and protests. Many couriers shared their photos, videos, and social media communications with me, which helped me reconstruct collective action. Existing literature tends to neglect management’s role (Veen et al. 2019), so I interviewed six people with management positions (four at service platforms, two at gig platforms). I also interviewed a system development engineer and an in-house lawyer to understand the technological and legal aspects of control and management. My assistants and I recorded and transcribed all 68 interviews. Second, I conducted online ethnography between 2018 and 2019. I joined four nationwide discussion boards used by food-delivery couriers in Baidu Tieba, one of the largest online communities in China. I also joined 10 social media groups formed by couriers. I examined the Weibo content of certain couriers who organized or participated in strikes or protests. Online ethnography enabled me to reach out to participants in collective action. I read discussions, listened to couriers’ voice messages, and took notes and screenshots. Third, I conducted on-the-ground ethnography in Chongqing. I began to conduct online ethnography with couriers in Chongqing two months before GPCs there organized a series of strikes and protests in May 2018. As Figure 1 shows, Chongqing is one of the many cities in which platform couriers staged collective action. I went to Chongqing in June 2018 to conduct fieldwork. When I arrived in Chongqing, many GPCs still had fresh memories of the collective action. I stayed in a plaza where gig couriers hung out and joined their conversations. One service platform station allowed me to observe their couriers’ and supervisors’ routines, and a gig platform manager allowed me to visit his office. After I left Chongqing, I continued to observe the situation through follow-up interviews. I analyzed and collected interview and ethnographic data iteratively, moving between data and theories. Initially, I designed my interview questions based on literature on algorithmic control. After conducting the first 20 interviews and some online ethnography, I began to analyze data. As a number of the emerging themes and codes did not appear in the literature on algorithmic control, my preliminary empirical analysis prompted me to develop a broader theoretical framework. I then revised my interview protocols based on the newly included literature. I did supplemental interviews with the first 20 interviewees and then conducted 48 more interviews. Fourth, I compiled a dataset that contains 87 cases of strikes or protests organized by food-delivery couriers between 2017 and 2018 in China. I use the term “strike” to mean a period of time during which people refuse to work; “protest” refers to the expression of opposition to something. All of the cases were both strikes and protests, as couriers not only refused to work but expressed their opposition to employers or platforms on banners or signs. I compiled the list from a professional news database (WiseNews), search engines, online communities, Weibo, WeChat, and the China Labour Bulletin. China Labour Bulletin is a labor NGO in Hong Kong that provides the most comprehensive data about labor disputes in China. The data I collected include texts describing strikes and protests and photos and videos. I documented slogans written on banners and signs. For each collective action, I coded the data in terms of type of platform, platform company, location, content of the complaint, and couriers’ actions. The dataset is limited in terms of its exhaustiveness, so I use these data to complement my interviews and ethnography data, rather than trying to subject them to rigorous quantitative analysis. Finally, I collected the texts of contracts between different actors involved in food delivery. I also compiled the texts of rules enacted by the two platform companies and their franchisees and local offices. In addition, I read 60 court decisions made by the Basic People’s Courts or Intermediate People’s Courts that listed either Meituan or Ele.me as one of the parties in the case. Most of the decisions concerned compensation following deaths or injuries of platform couriers or other parties due to traffic incidents. The disputes in these cases are not central to collective contention, but the court decisions provide detailed information about the legal and organizational design of the service and gig platforms. My legal education and six years of work experience as a legal professional facilitated my analysis of legal texts.",

Empirical research suggests that despite the preliminary development antitrust administrative litigations present the “four lowness” phenomenon, namely low start-up, low total case number, low rate of lawsuits against the competition authorities, and low winning rate for plaintiffs. The most severe problems remain two, namely plaintiffs' grounding and the scope of judicial review. It is both empirically urgent and theoretically necessary to establish special rules for antitrust administrative procedure. In order to promote and improve effective antitrust enforcement, it is proposed to recognize plaintiffs' grounding based on procedural participation, to let justice urge competition authorities to adopt procedural guidelines, and to mildly extend the scope of judicial review.",

    "abstract": "The adoption of director's duty of care in the 2005 revision of the PRC Company Law made significant progress in holding directors accountable for their wrongdoings. However, certain ects still exist, most importantly the lack ofa specific standard for the duty of care in the legislation. Therefore, this article adopts an empirical and comparative app roach in reviewing Chinese duty of care cases in comparison with major urisdictions such as the United Kingdom and the United States. The 86 sample cases hand-collected from the tenyear period from 2011 to 2020 reveal that the number of duty of care litigation in China is still far lower than other types of company disputes, despite an increasing trend. This article finds a divergence in judicial practice concerning at least two different standards of the duty of care, with an array of non-uniform factors considered in the judgments. Accordingly, this article adopts a selective approach concerning best practices in major jurisdictions globally and proposes several solutions specifically catered to China's legal and commercial context, including the unified adoption of the objective reasonable person standard, the suggestion that a wholesale transplant of the business judgment rule is undesirable while some of its elements could be borrowed for reference, the shifting of evidentiary burden to the defendants and the promotion of director's liability insurance. By incorporating these changes, China's company law stands to benefit from striking an appropriate balance between director's authority to manage the companies and shareholder's right to hold them accountable.",
    "conclusion": "By reviewing all the duty of care cases adjudicated by Chinese courts from 2011 to 2020, this article uncovered an increasing trend, with cases more concentrated in the economically more developed cities. This article also revealed the characteristics of the plaintiffs and the defendants and theoretically scrutinized the rationales behind the two different standards relied on by the courts. Against the current backdrop of an upcoming major revision of the PRC Company Law16 2 and after conducting a comparative analysis with other major jurisdictions such as the UK and the US, this article has made a few key recommendations for improving the duty of care regime in China. Such recommendations include the unified adoption of the objective reasonable person standard, the borrowing of elements of the business judgment rule for references without a wholesale adoption of the rule, the shifting of the burden of proof to the defendants and the promotion of D&O insurance. In conclusion, by incorporating these changes, China's company law stands to benefit from striking an appropriate balance between director's authority to manage the companies and shareholder's right to hold them accountable.",

    "abstract": "Since negotiating the Word Trade Organization's Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) during the 1986-94 Uruguay Round, the global intellectual property environment has become more predictable and consistent.1 The TRIPS Agreement establishes standards for the availability, scope, and use of seven forms of intellectual property, namely copyrights, trademarks, geographical indications, industrial designs, patents, layout designs for integrated circuits, and undisclosed information (trade secrets).2 However, it is important to note that the TRIPS Agreement sets the minimum level of protection, allowing for disharmony in certain intellectual property (IP) rights. One area where disharmony exists pertains to the eligibility of biological subject matters for patents, such as disease treatment and diagnosis methods, animals and plants, genetic resources, and stem cells.4 Different countries have adopted varying approaches in this regard, influenced by their culture, customs, and developmental status. This disharmony allows countries to adopt IP regimes that align with their needs and socio-economic conditions. However, disharmony can create challenges for global companies, as they may have to navigate different patent laws and regulations in different countries to protect their interests. This is particularly true in the case of biological subject matters, as standards appear to differ from one jurisdiction to another. Given the United States' position as the largest global economy and China's emergence as the second largest economy, both countries hold significant roles in international business and intellectual property protection. The United States (U.S.) has raised concerns regarding inadequate protection of foreign intellectual property rights in China. However, the Chinese government has undertaken substantial efforts to enhance IP protection and align its patent system with international standards. It is important to recognize that China and the U.S. have distinct cultural and traditional backgrounds. China has a long-standing community-based culture and tradition that emphasizes social value and collective benefits.6 Conversely, the U.S. has a property rights-based culture and tradition that strongly emphasizes protecting and rewarding individual inventors and innovators. Therefore, conducting a comparative analysis of the treatment of biological subject matters in Chinese and U.S. patent law is valuable to understand how cultural, customary, and developmental differences influence their approaches to protecting such subject matters. This comparison can provide insights into the underlying rationale behind their choices and in exploring potential avenues for harmonizing the two patent systems. The first part of this paper will examine the divergent aspects of eligible biological subject matters in the Chinese and U.S. patent law systems. It will shed light on their respective approaches, focusing on areas such as methods of treating or diagnosing human and animal diseases, plants and animals, genetic resources, and human stem cells. An analysis *67 of these differences can give a better understanding of their contrasting approaches. The second part of the paper will delve into potential areas for harmonization that can promote global IP protection and facilitate innovation in biotechnology and related industries. Exploring opportunities for aligning the Chinese and U.S. patent systems will contribute to creating a more cohesive and efficient framework for biotechnological innovation on an international scale.",
    "conclusion": "Disharmonies in intellectual property rights allow countries to explore and discover a balanced approach that protects inventions while accommodating their unique cultures, customs, and economic circumstances. As evidenced by the comparison between China and the U.S., each country has implemented patent laws tailored to its specific context, values, and goals, while also complying with its international treaties. China's exclusion of treatment and diagnosis methods from patent protection emphasizes the importance of accessibility to healthcare and collective well-being, promoting affordable options and preventing hindrance by patent monopolies. On the other hand, the U.S.'s allowance of patentability for these methods encourages medical innovation and provides incentives for research and development. Similarly, China's exclusion of animal and plant patentability is influenced by a complex interplay of cultural, customary, and developmental perspectives, prioritizing reverence for nature, traditional agricultural practices, and food security. While this may limit certain commercial opportunities, it underscores the importance of preserving cultural heritage, promoting shared benefits, and safeguarding access to genetic resources. The protection of genetic resources poses a complex global issue, requiring a balance between promoting innovation and safeguarding biological diversity and traditional knowledge. China's proactive incorporation of clauses in its patent law to align with the CBD principles showcases its commitment to protecting genetic resources while ensuring equitable sharing of benefits. Conversely, the U.S., while not a party to the CBD, prioritizes unrestricted access to genetic resources, presenting its own challenges in international cooperation. China's approach to human stem cell patentability, shaped by Confucian cultural values, prioritizes human dignity and genetic integrity, leading to strict regulations protecting human embryos. In contrast, the U.S. focuses on excluding judicially created exceptions, resulting in the granting of patents for human embryonic stem cells. Both approaches encounter unique challenges, with China's cultural emphasis potentially limiting scientific research and advancements, while the U.S. approach raises concerns about broad patents hindering future innovations. As cultures and customs evolve with economic development, it becomes essential for China to continually assess and adapt its patent laws, striking a balance between cultural values, societal needs, and technological progress. This will ensure that China's approach to biological subject matter eligibility remains responsive to the changing demands of society, promoting an environment where innovation and progress can flourish in harmony with its cultures and customs. A promising avenue to achieve this balance is by harmonizing eligibility of biological subject matters through compulsory licensing when voluntary licensing is not feasible or falls short. This avenue holds the potential to preserve community cultural values, encourage knowledge sharing, and ensure the affordability and widespread availability of essential technologies while fostering innovation. Additionally, it can help streamline international trade, encourage cross-border trade and investment, and promote economic integration and cooperation.",

    "abstract": "The principle of filial piety underpinned both parent-child relations and, more broadly, Qing legal and social order. Entering the turbulent years of the Qing-Republic transition, filial piety went through substantial changes. Drawn from the local legal archives in Jiangjin county, Sichuan, this research traces the transformation of filial piety in legal practice during the first half of the twentieth century. It argues that two overlapping processes-legal reforms and nation-state building-synergized to restructure the meaning of filial piety from a largely integrated principle in Qing, which bridged the gaps between filiality and loyalty to the emperor and between personalized morality and imperial state legitimacy, to divergent new interpretations of filial piety, including the individualist filial piety, nationalist filial piety, legal filial piety, and sentimental filial piety. Each new interpretation inherits only part of its original meaning and incorporates newly introduced legal knowledge of legal equality and property ownership. The article concludes that various, sometimes contradictory interpretations of filial piety indicate the Republican legal reforms as an in-between, dynamic spectrum of legal change with vigorous negotiations among different legal actors and knowledge regimes.",
    "conclusion": "Before the Republican era, filial piety reconciled filiality to parents with loyalty to the emperor and legality (in the Confucian ideal) under the processes of nation-state building and Republican legal reforms. However, this principle developed into different strands as nation-state building disintegrated the state-family continuum and as legal reforms de-Confucianized the legal system. As indicated in the local legal archives in Jiangjin, the transformation of filial piety crystallized in at least three aspects: legal punishment for unfilial behavior, property distribution with respect to who had the privileges or the power to determine inheritance, and the interpretations of what counted as filial. Over time, punishment for unfilial children gradually decreased in severity. Children obtained more say in property distribution. Love, deference, and financial responsibility within one’s family were decoupled from state legitimacy. The socially accepted concept of filiality also diverged from the legally acknowledged concept of filiality. Informed by new sources of knowledge during the Republican era, the universalist principle of filial piety grew into at least four new interpretations of social and legal relations. The ramifications and recreation of the integrated principle of filial piety were realized in legal practice through negotiations and struggles among those involved. The meaning of filial piety in use depended on the available knowledge during the immediate situation, as structured by legal reforms, nation-state building, and local particularities. Ultimately, the outcome was not one form of filial piety but multiple diverse, sometimes even contradictory, interpretations of filial piety. The four strands of filial piety provided resources for various actors, including lawyers, legal professionals, litigants, and plaintiffs, to use in actual legal practice. These interpretations interacted in legal practice through competition, negotiation, and compromise. Through such interactions, interpretations of filial piety empowered certain groups while marginalizing others. For example, in practice, local legal interpretations of parent-child relations were often gendered. Although codes and other legal designs canceled the parental authority of mothers, local legal practices continued to reinforce the powerful position of fathers. Women, especially mothers, were marginalized in this transitional moment, revealing the uneven influence and local implementation of legal reforms imposed on various social groups. Nonetheless, despite the patrilineal nature of property relations’ continuity, the transformation during the Qing-Republic transition indicates that the previously integrated notion of filial piety had gradually faded. Finally, these divergent interpretations of filial piety were recreated from the earlier integrated principle of filial piety, which continued to convey part of its original meaning. The inherited notion of filial piety and the foreigninspired notions (e.g. the nation-state and the rule of law) had together recreated legal categories used in the examined cases-such as lack of filial piety, legal dependency, senior authority, and private property-making these legal conceptions of filial piety hybrid in nature. Thus, Republican legal apparatuses reconciled the paradox of legal equality and parental authority. Filial piety’s historical transformation reveals the lens of knowledge production and transmission as a robust framework for examining the Republican legal system as a dynamic process of legal change, producing liminal knowledge that was neither wholly Confucian nor wholly Western.",

    "abstract": "\\introduction - In 2019, the Intermediate People's Court of Qiqihar City, Heilongjiang Province, China declared Heihua Co., Ltd (“Heihua”) bankrupt.1 Despite the fact that Heihua had made great contributions to economic development within the Heilongjiang province, it was also at fault for discharging vast amounts of smoke, dust, and heavy metals into the surrounding land and air which caused subsequent environmental damage, in terms of land and air pollution, as well as water contamination.2 Bankruptcy was attributable to these environmental issues, as well as the firm's aging equipment, yet the aforementioned environmental issues were not resolved following the completion of the bankruptcy process; with the soil and groundwater at the former Heihua site containing a large quantity of heavy metals far in excess of national standards, the site was later identified as heavily contaminated.3 Cleanup and restoration of the contaminated site is in the public's best interest.4 As the liquidation process of the bankrupt company has since concluded, it follows that any future rectification of consequential environmental damage stemming from the Heihua site must be covered by public funds.5 This highlights a common issue: the polluting company will be rendered bankrupt with several of its environmental issues still outstanding and pass any such liability on to the public--in other words, the cost of environmental liability will be borne by public funds.6 Based on the current environmental legal framework in China, both the Tort chapter of the Civil Code 2020 and the Environmental Protection Law 2014 apply the “polluter pays” principle, which requires polluters to assume responsibility for the cost of environmental *160 cleanup and/or its remediation and restoration.7 However, the polluter pays principle is being challenged by Chinese Enterprises Bankruptcy Law (“EBL”).8 In the context of EBL, environmental liability is classified as a general, unsecured liability in the order of distribution during the winding up process.9 In most cases generalized, unsecured claims face difficulty in being paid out of the funds from the winding up process, which results in the externalization or “transfer” of environmental costs from the bankrupt polluter to the public.10 These costs are known to economists as negative externalities.11 If such environmental costs were to be externalized to society, it would not be fair for those ordinary citizens that would be forced to foot the bill on behalf of a bankrupt firm.12 Those who cause damage to the environment ultimately benefit more from their actions because the cost of the damage, such as the government-funded cleanup and reduction in environmental quality, is not borne by individuals in proportion to their responsibility for the damage, but affects everyone indiscriminately.13 Likewise, this renders environmental costs free for those polluting who would otherwise be responsible for any damage caused, since it can simply be externalized to the public in the event of bankruptcy, or, in other words, companies may be incentivized to seek bankruptcy in order to avoid any such environmental liability.14 As such, if the externality of environmental costs to society was altered so that the respective polluters bore the costs they are responsible for, it would likely improve social justice with respect to post-bankruptcy liabilities.15 As an emerging economy, China has yet to gain the relevant experience necessary to effectively address the environmental liability of bankrupt polluters.16 Therefore, this Article *161 examines how Chinese law treats environmental liabilities in bankruptcy proceedings.17 In addition, this Article will discuss future direction to reform the EBL to internalize environmental costs in bankruptcy proceedings.18",
    "conclusion": "The polluter pays principle is explicitly detailed within Chinese environmental legislation, but this principle has been challenged in the context of bankruptcy law. 442 In practice, environmental costs have been transferred to society in bankruptcy proceedings, with many contaminated sites not having been cleaned up post-liquidation. 443 Some companies use bankruptcy regimes to escape their environmental responsibilities. 444 The enactment of EBL 2006 was a success in that it solved the problem of bankruptcy in China. 445 However, EBL 2006 has now become a haven for polluters insofar as environmental resources have become a somewhat free cost for companies under the bankruptcy framework in China. 446 From the perspective of the polluter pays principle, EBL 2006 has thus revealed a number of problems, such as a lack of environmental representation in bankruptcy proceedings, as well as environmental liabilities not being given priority in the winding up process. EBL 2006 should consider several changes to realize the internalization of environmental costs, such as giving priority to environmental liability in winding up and increasing the presence of environmental representatives in bankruptcy proceedings, which are recommendations on bankruptcy proceedings. 447 Meanwhile, the corporate entity post-liquidation is also an important way to internalize environmental costs. Therefore, the corporate veil should be lifted when there is sufficient evidence that a company’s shareholders have deliberately transferred property to avoid environmental liability, or that corporate accounts have been mixed with private accounts.",

    "abstract": "Political decentralization is often argued to strengthen political accountability by bringing government closer to the people. Social and civic institutions at the local level, such as lineage associations, temples, churches, or social clubs, can make it easier for citizens to monitor officials and hold them accountable. This article argues that strong social institutions also empower local elites who may use their informal influence to control their group and capture rents. Drawing on evidence from case studies of Chinese villages, the article shows that lineage group leaders who become village officials use their combination of social and political authority to confiscate villagers’ land. Evidence from a survey experiment suggests that endorsement of a land confiscation plan by lineage elites elicits greater compliance with property seizures. A national survey indicates that when a lineage leader becomes a village cadre, it is associated with a 14 to 20 percent increase in the likelihood of a land expropriation. The findings demonstrate how informal institutions and local civil society can be tools of top-down political control.",
    "conclusion": "the lesson of this article is simple: local civil society groups often serve as tools of political control, and cannot replace formal institutions of accountability. as work by ostrom and tsai shows, nonstate groups can to a certain extent help members police themselves, especially in the context of repeated interaction. 58 When these groups are truly autonomous, they can even help curb state predation. For example, similar to the findings presented here, timothy Frye finds that business organizations in russia can help protect private property. 59 But the incorporation of the leaders of these groups into state institutions does not represent real political inclusion, rather, it is a form of co-optation. these findings show how seemingly democratic institutions can serve as institutions of co-optation even at the lowest level of politics. the literature to date has shown how regimes co-opt elites in national legislatures 60 and how authoritarian institutions help the regime distribute rents and resolve conflict between political factions. 61 Scholars of Chinese politics have also investigated how the regime has experimented with feedback mechanisms, transparency, and limited press freedoms to gather information about the behavior of local officials. 62 Yet the logic of political co-optation in local politics is comparatively unexplored. Future work might examine whether co-opting local elites is an effective long-term strategy. it may not be, since once local elites have used their power to capture rents from land development, they lose their moral authority. in the short term, this may not matter to local officials as long as they can extract enough from each village to fill local coffers (as well as their own pockets). Yet there are only so many villages in which this governance strategy can be repeated, and so it may trade short-term gains for long-term problems-as has arguably occurred with social service policies or efforts to strengthen rule of law without an independent judiciary or civil society.63 these findings stand in stark contrast to a number of recent studies that have linked strong informal institutions in rural China to high levels of public goods provision. 64 these findings also raise the question of whether there is a trade-off between public goods and property rights-a bargain in which villagers receive more public goods but have weaker land rights might benefit local elites. Future work on distributive politics in rural China should examine public goods alongside local development policies. outside of China, there are intriguing parallels between the role of lineage leaders and other types of local political brokers. the most obvious may be with traditional leaders such as tribal chiefs. Daron acemog˘lu, tristan reed, and James robinson find that chiefs in Sierra leone exploit their control over local civil society to control local politics and development. 65 Kate Baldwin shows how national leaders cede control over land to traditional chiefs to increase electoral support among noncoethnics. 66 interestingly, Baldwin also finds that voters tend to cast their ballots for political candidates endorsed by chiefs because they infer, correctly, that politicians with connections to chiefs will provide higher levels of public goods. 67 this is broadly consistent with the idea that traditional kinship institutions can help buttress public goods provision, which occurs in a context of repeated interaction and relatively low stakes, but leaves open the question of what role these elite might play in large-scale land requisitions. recent work by lauren Honig finds that it is autonomous chiefs with power that historically has been independent of the state that protect their constituents from land confiscation.68 a second parallel is with other types of brokers in the developing world. there is intriguing evidence that outside of China, local brokers also trade targeted benefits in return for support for elites, who often gain much more in the bargain. 69 For example, tariq thachil shows how elite parties in india use nonstate groups to supply services to the poor and in return, the poor vote for parties whose policies disproportionately benefit the elite. 70 other types of brokers, such as the leaders of informal settlements, 71 could play similar roles in other contexts. in general, elite capture of decentralized institutions is probably widespread. For example, Edmund Malesky, Cuong Viet nguyen, and anh tran show how in Vietnam local councils were captured by existing political elite, who diverted public resources for their own benefit.72 as a consequence, the abolition of local councils led to a surprising improvement in public service provision. My research also shows that elite capture is not inevitable. When village officials in China face competition from lineage elites who have not joined local political institutions, their behavior is constrained, and land requisitions are less likely. in this way, rival elites can play a positive role, acting as informal watchdogs and using their informal authority to encourage collective action when local officials bend the law.",

    "abstract": "This study examines whether ex ante securities litigation risk prompts firms to make more or less voluntary restatements. The litigation risk is captured by a new measure based on the dismissal rate of the district court where the firm is headquartered. We find that misreporting firms headquartered in lenient (high dismissal rate) court jurisdictions are more likely to make voluntary restatements. Using the U.S. Supreme Court’s Tellabs decision as an exogenous shock that reduces the leniency of some district courts, we find robust evidence that higher litigation risk decreases managers’ incentives to admit their misreporting. Our finding sheds new light on the litigation risk-voluntary disclosure paradox by pointing to a positive aspect of court leniency in motivating self-policing behavior such as restatement.",
    "conclusion": "This study provides the first evidence that district court pleading standards, as measured by the PSL dismissal rate, affect the likelihood that misreporting firms will admit their accounting mistakes through voluntary restatements. We find strong and robust evidence that a lenient legal environment encourages voluntary restatements. Using the Supreme Court’s Tellabs decision as an exogenous shock to the securities litigation environment, we find that a decrease in court leniency leads to a decrease in firms’ voluntary restatement propensity. Additional tests show that we are capturing the effect of court leniency on voluntary restatement but not firms’ misreporting. Our results are robust to different samples of misreporting firms and alternative court dismissal rate measures. This study complements existing literature on the impact of ex ante litigation risk on firms’ voluntary disclosure (of bad news). Our novel evidence points to hitherto under-investigated role of the courts in motivating self-policing behavior such as voluntary restatements. Future research on litigation risk shall therefore take into account district court level pleading standard, in addition to the industry-level, firm-level, and circuit level litigation risk. Our study points to a positive aspect of court leniency (in the context of stringent U.S. litigation environment) in prompting misreporting firms to admit their mistakes. Regulators in the future may consider this mechanism in conjunction with public and private enforcement to fight against financial misreporting.",

    "abstract": "This article employs a techno-econo-legal approach to analyze the potential “coopetition” (i.e., cooperation between competitors) between China and South Korea in the electric vehicle (EV) energy market. The investigation assesses a wide range of techno-econo-legal factors, including battery capacity, energy density, innovation, production capacity, and legal considerations. These legal considerations encompass intellectual property rights, trade practices, and environmental regulations. The central argument of this analysis posits that while South Korea holds an advantage in technological innovation, China’s superior production capacity and governmental support present significant challenges. The relative success in this domain relies not only on technological proficiency and resource availability but also on the techno-econo-legal frameworks and legal systems governing these two nations. This distinction reflects the diversity between the Global North and the Global South countries. Additionally, the choice between Nickel-Cobalt-Manganese (NCM) and Lithium-Iron-Phosphate (LFP) batteries is a significant factor for these two competing nations. The article provides recommendations for adopting a coopetition strategy as a policy measure, which aims to promote equitable cooperation, moderated competition, and sustainable development in the global EV battery industry.",
    "conclusion": "While both China and South Korea have distinct advantages in the EV battery market, they also face significant challenges. Collaboration and innovation will be the key to their success in this rapidly evolving industry. The potential benefits of cost savings, technology sharing, and energy conservation make it a promising option for companies seeking a competitive advantage in the global EV market. The coopetition between China and South Korea in the EV battery industry is multifaceted, with both nations having distinct advantages. With the coopetitive framework in place, EV battery suppliers in China and South Korea can shape the industry’s future. In conclusion, the competition between China and South Korea in the EV battery industry is complex, with important legal and regulatory considerations. While both countries have significant advantages and challenges, it is worthwhile to note that a coopetition strategy combining cooperation and competition can ensure a win-win solution for both countries as the EV battery industry continues to grow and innovate.",

    "abstract": "This Note aims to explore a new global framework for governing algorithms under international trade law. Algorithms are instructions for solving a problem or completing a task based on the past data collected from the users of applications operated by transnational big tech companies. Using the implied adverse effects of algorithms (e.g., people being unaware that their choices and decisions will be driven by an inaccessible algorithmic system) and the trend of algorithmic governance in different jurisdictions, this Note aims to compare the actions taken by the United States, China, and the European Union, about how they react to the algorithmic era, and how they regulate the use of algorithms conducted by covered entities and develop an international framework for the global governance on algorithms. There are commonalities and differences among the actions taken by the United States, China, and the EU. There is a prevalent legislative trend to regulate algorithmic tools by mandating transparency and accountability to prevent adverse effects for personal information possessors. Based on the analysis of synthesizing the differences, this Note sees a possibility to explore a global framework for algorithmic governance and provides two directions on global governance on the algorithms which consists of strengthening the global collaboration and setting up a relevant multilateral treaty.",
    "conclusion": "National legislative trends are a reminder that it is time to globalize algorithmic governance. Based on adverse effects brought about by the worldwide use of algorithms, especially the potential global impact of algorithms created by transnational business entities, there is a growing pressure to unite countries in the governance of algorithms.240 In light of this Note’s comparative analysis, the United States, China, and the EU have all introduced or passed legislation about algorithmic governance, even if some of their provisions are not as detailed as one would like. 241 Existing regulations on algorithmic governance are almost all domestic; however, transnational business entities that deploy algorithms around the world affect international commerce and norms. 242 In that case, cross-border and uniform governance of algorithms requires cooperation among countries, based on the trend towards harmonization in national legislation. To conduct algorithmic governance around the world, a multilateral framework should be based on the common purpose and solutions of the United States, China, and the EU. In this hypothetical international framework, this Note pays more attention to the covered entities, transparency, self-assessment, and sanctions. Those four dimensions provide the most salient criteria for designing a new framework because the different legislations all pay attention to them. For the covered entities, the risk-based approach issued by AI Act is more likely to be acceptable in the global governance. As to transparency and self-assessment, both requirements need to be fulfilled by the coordination of a third-party institution to play a role as a supervisor. Fines are still the most efficient way to punish the covered entities. A high-level standard of sanctions will have a better effect on global algorithmic governance. A global response to governing algorithms is necessary. An international framework consisting of a uniform standard of transparency, a multilateral agreement, and a panel to provide a grievance mechanism to the people affected by algorithms could be a step in the right direction.",

    "abstract": "The connection between court resources and judicial behavior has long been acknowledged. This article examines the linkages between local governments' fiscal pressures and Chinese judges' decisions on financial sanctions. Based on data from criminal verdicts of official corruption and county government expenditures, this study finds that Chinese judges are more likely to impose financial penalties, especially fines, when judicial expenditures in a region are low. The conclusion remains unchanged after accounting for the endogeneity problem using the age of the county party secretary and the per capita financial expenditure lagged for one period as instrumental variables. Finally, the imprisonment penalty without increasing revenue is used to test the placebo, and no effect of fiscal pressure on the imprisonment penalty is found.",
    "conclusion": "We organize data regarding the first trial of criminal cases on embezzlement and bribery crimes published by courts, matching them with the per capita financial expenditures of counties in China. Then, we empirically test the influence of fiscal pressure on judges’ financial penalty decisions. It is found that China’s courts exhibit great differences in their economic punishment of corrupt officials, which is related to the financial incentives caused by local fiscal pressure. When court funds in a region are lower, the judges there have stronger incentives to issue financial penalties to maximize court revenue, part of which comes from commissions from the local government according to the value of financial penalties judged and executed by each court. This phenomenon is more obvious for fines, which have a stronger ability to increase revenue for the court. This phenomenon of fiscal incentives caused by fiscal pressure is more prominent in regulatory agencies, including the police force, procuratorates and courts, which have a strong ability to increase revenue. Incomes from fines and confiscations have become an important source of increased local revenue, are included in budget management and decomposed to criminal justice personnel at various levels, and are even used as an indicator in evaluations. The Ministry of Finance issued the \"Measures for the Administration of Fines and Confiscated Property\" to the Supreme People’s Court, the Supreme People’s Procuratorate, the Supervisory Commission, and the Department (Bureau) of Finance in various provinces and cities as well as other relevant departments on December 17th, 2020, emphasizing once again: \"The budget of fines and confiscations in the government budget revenue is a predictive index and is not issued as a revenue task index. The funds for criminal justice agencies to handle cases are guaranteed to be provided by the budget of the government at the corresponding level, and the budget arrangements for law enforcement agencies should not be linked to the fines and confiscation cases they handle in any year.\" This indicates that there is indeed a clear phenomenon in which the value of fines and confiscated property is taken as an evaluation index in judicial practice. Economic incentives and competition forge a close link between the behavior of judicial personnel and economic interests, leading them to selectively enforce the law, expand the scope of punishment for some crimes, and even identify one crime as another crime to increase the benefits derived from fines and confiscated property. This common judicial injustice is driven by the desire to obtain more income from financial penalties (Smercina et al., 2022). If the behavior of judicial personnel is not only linked to criminal activities but also affected by local finances and economic interests, then the justice offered by the courts will be in doubt, harming judicial credibility and therefore causing serious damage to social justice. Therefore, the legal system should be improved, the reform of the financial system should be accelerated, and the judicial reform process should be promoted. The joint results of these changes can achieve the goal of judicial fairness and justice. Three policy implications should be considered. First, full funding for the judicial branch should be ensured, and the reform of unified financial management of the judiciary should be further accelerated. In particular, the government should speed up the financial reform in the regions where financial management is jointly administered by the provincial and local governments and the traditional management of local government is maintained. Historical problems, such as the complicated staffing of courts, large regional differences in the salaries of judicial personnel within a province, and confusion about the court property belonging to judicial agencies or the government, need to be resolved, as these are enormous obstacles to the centralized management of the financial resources of local courts below the provincial level (Xu, 2021). Second, the legal system related to financial penalties should be improved, and the sentencing standards for financial penalties should be clarified, especially in terms of the differences between property confiscation and fine penalty provisions. Third, the income from fines and confiscations should be handed over directly to the central government, a special fund system for fines and confiscations with specified purposes should be designated, and the expenditure of fines and confiscations should be made public.",

Using civil society network analysis, this article aims to identify and account for interactions between the EPIL Network and other stakeholders, including the government. Finally, the study highlights the contributions of the EPIL Network, which provides an option for resolving political conflicts in China regarding municipal waste management.",
    "conclusion": "The EPIL has become an influential tool in municipal waste politics. In the beginning, the EPIL Network aimed to serve as an independent third party between ENGOs and local governments to engage them in dialogue and cooperation and to try to provide them with neutral information. The new environmental protection law and the judicial interpretations that further clarified the standing of environmental groups in filing EPILs in the courts in 2015 were the legal basis and background of the EPIL support network. In recent years, with professionalized reform and advancement, the EPIL Network’s role in leading environmental litigation has grown; it influences government policies and collaborates with courts and government actors to leverage social impact. Working with legal professionals and local courts, the EPIL Network has built extensive capacity in environmental public interest litigation as well as in cases of waste problems. Wells-Dang points out that it is difficult for civil society organization networks in China to build networks with government agencies. 47 In this study, however, the EPIL has made not only horizontal networks among participants but also vertical networks between citizens and government officials. The members of the EPIL Network mutually reinforce their missions and efforts, leading to improved outcomes in managing municipal waste. 48 Working with different stakeholders, the EPIL Network has more expertise in MSW management systems and policies to identify sources of litigation cases that have strategic implications for the MSW system. Additionally, the EPIL Network supports its members in effectively developing litigation strategies to achieve their goals and their dynamics help improve the EPIL system. Nevertheless, the EPIL Network attempts to establish relationships through the courts with the government to provide resolutions on waste management. The collaboration between the EPIL Network and local governments reveals that local governments consult with NGOs and tend to have more policy influence.49 To conclude, the study illustrates the role of the EPIL Network in the politics of municipal waste management in China. By looking at this civil society organization network and discussing its formation, structure, communication, and dynamics with the Chinese government and different stakeholders, we found that the possibility of resolving conflicts related to managing municipal waste lies in wise networking. The network members function as mediators and facilitators between the state and citizens in the politics of municipal waste management, which provides an option for solving conflicts in the country.",

    "abstract": "Natural disasters are “unnatural.”2 The risk of disasters is often a combination of social, economic, and environmental factors, such as land planning,3 poverty,4 and deteriorating ecosystems.5 At present, human activities could trigger or exacerbate the consequences of natural disasters on a global scale, putting the lives of millions of people at risk and undoing social and economic gains.6 In particular, as climate change evolves, the number of natural disasters associated with it has significantly increased. For example, the number of annual flood disasters worldwide rose from 1,389 to 3,254 between 2000 and 2019, accounting for 40% of the total number of *363 disasters and affecting 1.65 million people.7 The number of annual storm disasters rose from 1,457 to 2,034 in that time, accounting for 28% of the total number of disasters.8 In addition, the number of droughts, wildfires, extreme temperatures, and other natural disasters, such as earthquakes and tsunamis, have increased significantly.9 China experiences some of the most frequent and serious natural disasters in the world.10 These natural disasters are diverse, widespread, frequent, and damaging11 and have hindered China's sustainable development and “ecological civilization” construction.12 In some ecologically fragile and economically impoverished areas, a negative feedback cycle occurs in which economic and social considerations influence development.13 This in turn influences the level of ecological impact from frequent natural disasters.14 Furthermore, ecologically fragile, vegetated areas in ecological transition overlap with areas in the composite interlaced zones of agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry, which suffer from ecological problems as a result of short-sighted management.15 According to the 2008 National Plan for the Protection of Ecologically Fragile Areas, economic losses in these areas due to various natural disasters, such as floods, sandstorms, mudslides, and landslides, cost about 200 billion yuan16 per year, *364 and the natural disaster loss rate increases by an average of 9% per year, which is higher than the average GDP growth rate of ecologically fragile areas.17 Additionally, between 1989 and 2019, the average annual disaster area of China's crops reached 40.2 million hectares, the average annual death toll was 870 (excluding 2008),18 and more than 80% of disaster-related casualties and economic losses occurred in rural areas.19 Extreme climate events frequently result in meteorological disasters because more than 70% of the 830 poverty-stricken counties in the country are in areas vulnerable to flooding and related disasters.20 In recent decades, ecosystem degradation induced many of the mega-natural disasters21 that occurred in China.22 In addition to natural conditions, human actions that cause deterioration of the ecological environment are important factors in mega-natural disasters.23 These actions include significant farmland reclamation around lakes, which greatly shrinks the area of lakes and wetlands, causes severe damage to forest cover within the *365 watershed, and thereby contributes to increased soil erosion.24 In 2010, for example, a devastating landslide occurred in Zhouqu County of the Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture within the Gansu Province, killing 1,557 people, leaving 208 missing, flooding two-thirds of Zhouqu County, and affecting 50,000 people in total.25 Besides the natural causes of the disaster--geology, landscape, extreme rainstorms, and drought--human activities in Zhouqu, like poor urban planning, serious deforestation and land reclamation, and excessive development and construction of water conservancy resources, have aggravated disasters and their consequences.26 Human action has also contributed to the frequent urban floods in recent years.27 One of the leading causes is the rapid expansion of cities, which has diminished the ecological regulatory function of natural features, weakening urban stormwater management.28 It is essential to strengthen the sustainable use of natural resources and integrated ecosystem management for disaster risk reduction. In response to this need, the ecosystem-based approach to disaster risk reduction (EbADRR) has emerged.29 This approach is based on management principles, strategies, and tools that maximize the use of ecosystem services to reduce disaster risk and achieve sustainable and resilient development goals.30 In 2008, the World Bank proposed the exploration of nature-based solutions (NbS) as a strategy for mitigating and adapting to climate change.31 Since then, the concept of NbS has become an umbrella for ecosystem-related approaches, which are defined as “actions to protect, sustainably manage and restore natural or modified ecosystems, which address societal challenges ... effectively and adaptively, while simultaneously providing human well-being and biodiversity benefits.”32 *366 Environmental law can be a powerful tool to ensure the implementation of NbS strategies in the context of disasters by focusing on ecosystem protection.33 Coincident with the drafting of an ecological code in China, this paper aims to seize this opportunity to transform the legal application of NbS to disasters from discrete to systematic. This Article is structured in four parts. Part I provides an overview of the global natural disaster landscape, with a specific focus on China, including notable incidents like the 1998 Yangtze River floods, the 2010 Gansu Zhouqu mudslide disaster, and the growing issue of urban flooding. This Part also examines the intricate interplay between ecosystems and natural disasters. Part II contends that environmental law can be the vehicle for utilizing NbS to mitigate natural disasters. This Part redefines natural disasters, acknowledging them as products of social, economic, and ecological factors. Consequently, comprehensive disaster risk management assumes paramount importance. Within this framework, NbS emerges as a novel model for disaster risk reduction, offering cost-effective, multifunctional, resilient, and stakeholder-inclusive strategies.34 By analyzing some of China's longstanding ecological engineering projects--the 1978 Three North Shelterbelt project,35 the 1988 Coastal Shelterbelt Program,36 the 1989 Shelterbelt Program for Upper and Middle Reaches of Yangtze River,37 and the 1999 Grain for Green project38--this Article underlines their notable achievements while also raising questions about their scientific and legal underpinnings. Part III focuses on how the application of NbS to disasters is already part of Chinese environmental law. Through an examination of 42 pieces of environmental and related legislation, this Part presents an overview of the profiles and specific contexts of this function. Of these laws, 27 are dedicated in varying extents to disaster risk reduction, with ecological protection legislation being the most comprehensive. The analysis reveals that the *367 existing disaster-risk-reduction function within environmental law encompasses both singular environmental measures and ecosystem approaches. The former primarily targets private entities, while the latter is chiefly steered by governmental entities without corresponding accountability requirements. Furthermore, the existing legal framework tends to prioritize isolated and discrete disaster risk prevention, sidelining the need for comprehensive and holistic risk management. Part IV further elaborates on the characteristics of discrete nature-based solutions to disasters via the environmental legal system. This includes the scattered legislative model under the dominance of reductionism, the incomplete interaction between science and the legal system, and noticeable imbalances in rights, duties, and responsibilities. Lastly, this part also proposes how NbS should be systematically integrated into the draft of the Ecological Environment Code.",
    "conclusion": "Constructing an ecological civilization in China requires innovation within the legal system and, consequently, the improvement of existing legal mechanisms and the creation of new ones. Compiling the Ecological Environment Code provides a favorable approach and is a valuable opportunity for achieving these goals. 300 Synergizing the framework for nature-based solutions to disaster risk reduction is essential; although a loose framework governing risk reduction exists, it remains underdeveloped and deserves more thorough attention. This Article serves as an initial exploration of these ideas, inviting further discussion and insights from experts in the field.",

    "abstract": "Internet-based platforms are increasingly being used by governments around the world to facilitate public engagement with citizens. However, it remains an open question whether participation through these platforms can actually enable citizens to influence policies. We address this question by studying the patterns and consequences of online participation at a major electronic petition platform in China, a country with the world's largest Internet-using population. Content analysis of over 900,000 petitions reveals that a substantial share of them concern lower-class issues and are originated from less developed rural and suburban areas. Linking variations in petition volumes to an original data set of government policy priorities, we further show that online participation led governments to place greater emphasis on social welfare policies and to increase the coverage of a key low-income assistance program. These results underscore the potential of online participation as an important mechanism to improve the quality of governance.",
    "conclusion": "As one of the most influential technological inventions of the 20th century, the Internet is seen by many as having the potential to give citizens a louder voice in the political process. However, concrete evidence on whether and how Internet-based participation can affect government policies remains limited to date. This article addresses this gap by presenting new evidence on the policy consequences of online participation from China's largest electronic petition platform. Contrary to the prevailing view that in developing countries the Internet is still a luxury technology enjoyed mainly by middle- and upper-class elites (Norris, 2001), our results suggest that when broadband infrastructure is made nearly universal, those from lower-class backgrounds will actively take advantage of new online channels to articulate their interests, and that their participation can lead local governments to place higher priority on social welfare issues in both rhetoric and actual policy implementation. Our article speaks to the literature on the relation between the Internet and governance. Existing research has found that the Internet can help strengthen government accountability (Besley & Burgess, 2002) and reduce corruption (Bailard, 2009), but may also suppress voter turnout (Campante, Durante, & Sobbrio, 2013) and increase ideological polarization (Lelkes, Sood, & Iyengar, 2017). On the issue of political inequality, more specifically, empirical findings from survey-based studies in advanced democracies (the United States in particular) tend to support the view that the Internet will reinforce, rather than alleviate, the participation and influence gaps in the offline world (Norris, 2001; Schlozman, Verba, & Brady, 2010). Our findings suggest that the conclusion drawn from the experience of developed countries may not necessarily apply to a developing context where the opportunities for conventional forms of participation are more biased and limited. We provide evidence that supports the Internet's potential to mitigate participation inequality among citizens and show that bringing in new voices into politics can substantively change governments' policy priorities. While we certainly need to be cautious to not overgeneralize findings from one platform, it is worth noting that some of the key features that made the platform effective, including operational independence, ease of access, and transparency, are not rare qualities in the cyberspace. As many other countries and regions have started to adopt similar electronic petition platforms, a promising direction of future research will be to investigate whether a similar equalizing impact also exists in other country settings. This article also contributes to a nascent but rapidly growing literature on nonelectoral responsiveness. Several recent studies have shown that in some non-Western political systems, and China in particular, inquiries and demands made by individual citizens receive replies from governments at a comparable rate as in electoral democracies (Chen et al., 2016; Distelhorst & Hou, 2017), and that individual politicians are generally attentive to citizen opinions (Meng, Pan, & Yang, 2014; Truex, 2016). So far, however, there is still limited evidence on whether, in the absence of formal electoral accountability, the preferences and demands expressed by citizens will be systematically taken into account in government policymaking-a more fundamental criterion of political responsiveness according to the original formulation of this concept (Dahl, 1998; Miller & Stokes, 1963). Our findings suggest the existence of a form of responsiveness in China that matches with its canonical definition in the democratic context. Finally, our analysis advances a more nuanced view on the relation between the Internet and the durability of the Chinese regime. While previous studies tend to portray a largely confrontational picture, focusing on either the subversive capacity of the Internet or the regime's efforts to control and manipulate the cyberspace (King, Pan, & Roberts, 2013, 2017), our findings suggest that the interaction between the two is not always zero-sum: The democratic potential of the Internet may be harnessed by the government to fulfill important governing functions. As such, the development of Internet may contribute to the regime's vitality by allowing it to improve the quality of governance without making more radical changes to its political institutions.",

    "abstract": "Beijing's growing global influence has led to increased Chinese participation in various international initiatives, many of which intersect with international law, from trade to climate change. This has prompted scholars to focus more on China's engagement with international law, aiming to develop effective strategies for interacting with this emerging global power. Any analysis of international law's role in a domestic system must consider the relevant actors, their influences, the issues they address, and the prevailing legal regime. This article offers new insights into Chinese policy formation by examining how influential domestic groups impact decision-making on specific public international law issues, their policy preferences, and their level of influence. It focuses primarily on non-state actors operating independently from the formal establishment, including State-owned enterprises (SOEs), private sector firms, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), netizens, and media. This article further examines the roles of these domestic actors within the internal policy-making process regarding matters of international law and how international law, in response, either constrains or empowers these actors. Finally, this article evaluates how increased participation of non-state actors might impact government accountability. This evaluation considers the broader context of rivalries among ministries and committees within the State Council, the evolving distribution of responsibilities, power dynamics between central and local governments, and the ongoing legal capacity-building efforts of relevant agencies.",
    "conclusion": "To conclude, state actors striving for economic growth partner with SOEs and influential private sector players, who are primarily motivated by profit, in the formulation and implementation of public policies. When viewed as crucial tools for socio-economic progress, there is a common ground between such enterprises and public stakeholders at different levels. This alliance would be a durable and powerful influence over the formulation of mainly inward-looking policies, which are less likely to be trumped by broader considerations of non-economic national interests. NGOs can establish bridging connections through official sponsorship, supervision, or informal endorsements. An illustration of this is the significant role played by academia from government-affiliated universities in advocating for policy changes within the party-state’s control. This can include participating in legislative and political consultation processes at the central and local levels, as well as engaging in individual litigation that aims for specific and partial modifications, rather than systematic ones. Finally, with increasing limitations placed on NGOs, the Internet has emerged as an effective means of grassroots policy-shaping, providing an alternative avenue for advocacy and mobilization. Even for less sensitive environmental NGOs, such as those that have successfully utilized online campaigns as part of their advocacy for policy changes, many of them have primarily shifted the focus of their activities to implementation. Such NGOs now engage mainly in monitoring and public interest litigation, public education, and advocacy for environment-friendly policies and legislation, rather than mobilization, so that they would obtain and maintain a formal legal status after the revised Environmental Protection Law entered into force on January 1, 2015.295 The capacity of public opinion to influence foreign policy changes in China hinges on the impact of the relevant issue on the Government’s domestic standing. Social issues that gain widespread attention, especially in the digital age, require the Government to respond to external disclosure and questioning since its oversight of information channels has evolved. The 2015 documentary on air pollution and the Diaoyu Islands incident are examples of public opinion playing a role in shaping policy. Chinese nationalists who believed there was a mismatch between the party-state’s historical narrative for legitimizing its rule and the pragmatic policies it implemented in the present to pursue state interests triggered the protests during the Diaoyu Islands incident. Public attention made it difficult for the central government to deviate from the path of behavior dictated by the radical nationalists who dominate public opinion by soberly handling territorial disputes or smoothly advancing trade negotiations. The 2015 documentary on air pollution gained significant public interest. It sparked intense debates throughout China due to the widespread recognition and awareness of severe smog and haze, which have negatively impacted the health of every individual living in polluted regions. In this regard, the central government had resolved to confront air pollution, but it aimed to conceal these shortcomings in governance from public scrutiny to safeguard its reputation for good governance and potentially expedite internal reforms. The common feature of these occurrences was the swift and unforeseen emergence of public opinions that spread beyond the party-state’s control with the assistance of the Internet. Although the government limited public access to the 2015 documentary within two weeks of its release, with official directives prohibiting Chinese news media from further reporting on it,296 Internet-based communication enabled the rapid dissemination of the information conveyed by the documentary to a broader audience. This led to increased public awareness and the formation of dominant public opinion within a short time. Nonetheless, the impact of online public opinion on instigating change is limited unless it effectively connects a foreign affairs issue to domestic concerns, resonating with the Chinese public and prompting the country’s political leaders to take action to protect their standing. Without clear guidance to direct public opinion towards specific objectives, its ability to advocate for significant policy reforms would be diminished. Additionally, online public opinion is decentralized and can be manipulated to further irrational policy outcomes. Some of the activists who were detained by the Japanese Coast Guard in the Diaoyu Islands incident, which in turn inflamed the radical nationalist opinion, were subsequently found to be separationists. These radicals had publicly defaced the Chinese national flag and the regional flag of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, burned the national flag, and, in mid-2014, even after the regularization of Chinese maritime police patrol, attempted to land on the disputed islands again. Thus, the intention of these “patriots” is suspect.297 Given that online public opinion is mercurial and intractable, it would likely provoke the government to use more draconian regulations to manage potential risks. Further, the party-state will not relax its vigilance against any external autonomous force beyond its control. This was particularly evident when decision-makers became concerned and implemented stricter information control measures after online public opinion played a significant role in influencing the government’s policies during the 2012 Sino-Japan territorial dispute. Thus, whether public sentiment can bring about policy changes would also rely on the resilience of messages linked to China’s key concerns in the face of increased information management measures.",

    "abstract": "Women are underrepresented in legislature almost worldwide, and China is no exception. Although the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) implemented its first gender quota in 1933, gender quotas and women's representation in China remain understudied. This study fills the literature gap by examining the subnational variation in gender quota implementation and women's representation in the county-level people's congresses (CPC). Through a comparison of four county-level units in Hunan and Hubei with similar socioeconomic features yet contrasting results in the numbers of female representatives elected in the 2016 CPC election, this study argues that women's access to CPCs is affected by the CCP's adoption and enforcement of grassroots quotas. The fieldwork shows that although all cases introduced a 30 per cent gender quota, only CPCs in Hunan province were able to meet the quota requirements. This was because the grassroots quota threshold was raised in Hunan and strictly enforced, partly as a response to the 2013 Hengyang vote-buying scandal. In contrast, CPCs in Hubei province nominated a large number of “first hands” (yibashou) candidates, very few of whom were women.",
    "conclusion": "In an election that relies on the top-down selection of nominees rather than the voluntary and proactive running of candidates, affirmative action such as quota enforcement can be especially effective in increasing women's representation when socioeconomic factors are held constant. While the CCP's affirmative actions - for example, vetoing nominations, partnering Party nominees with less qualified voter nominees, and background checks - are primarily aimed at securing election victory for its preferred candidates,Footnote47 they have also proved to be crucial for implementing and fulfilling quotas. Despite the Hunan Provincial Communist Party's exhortations to include more grassroots representatives, local agents continued to nominate first hands until the organization department and CPC intervened. Without the Party's intervention during the nomination stage, the CPCs in Hunan would have just paid lip service to quotas to the effect that the quotas would have made no impact and would have been meaningless - as was the case with the CPCs in Hubei when they just nominated first hands under a different label.",

    "abstract": "This article explores the role of formal education and specific legal knowledge in the process of legal mobilization. Using survey data and in-depth case narratives of workplace disputes in China, we highlight three major findings. First, and uncontroversially, higher levels of formal education are associated with greater propensity to use legal institutions and to find them more effective. Second, informally acquired labor law knowledge can substitute for formal education in bringing people to the legal system and improving their legal experiences. The Chinese state's propagation of legal knowledge has had positive effects on citizens' legal mobilization. Finally, while education and legal knowledge are factors that push people toward the legal system, actual dispute experience leads people away from it, especially among disputants without effective legal representation. The article concludes that the Chinese state's encouragement of individualized legal mobilization produces contradictory outcomes-encouraging citizens to use formal legal institutions, imbuing them with new knowledge and rights awareness, but also breeding disdain for the law in practice.",
    "conclusion": "China's Legal Dissemination Campaign began in the mid-1980s. Since that time the government has invested a significant amount of time and resources in teaching the population about law at schools, at the workplace, and in the media (Exner 1995). In the case narratives above, disputants make use of these resources to become informed consumers of legal institutions. In some cases, they make up for a lack in formal education to become seasoned experts, helping friends and colleagues with similar problems. Gaining knowledge and experience is part of the legal mobilization process. Although political participation in authoritarian regimes is, by definition, more narrowly circumscribed and restricted, in this case the state has instrumentally expanded the space for individualized mobilization, delegating the task of law enforcement to workers themselves. However, the effects of this engagement are contradictory. The citizenry is more active, engaged, and discriminating, but many who take the state's exhortations to use the law seriously end up disaffected with legal institutions, especially when they lack effective representation. More positive experiences and evaluations of the legal system tend to accrue to those at the higher end of the labor market.",

    "abstract": "When Yang Shuping, an exchange student from China, delivered a commencement address at the University of Maryland in May of 2017,1 she prompted criticism from her home state's government.2 At the commencement, Yang spoke about the “fresh air” of free speech and expression she experienced in the United States, articulating that “[d]emocracy and free speech should not be taken for granted ... [they] are worth fighting for.”3 While presumably uncontroversial to the Western listener, American news outlets were quick to note that the response from the People's Republic of China (P.R.C.) was stern.4 According to U.S. media, “[s]tate run-newspapers [in China] fanned the flames of controversy” when those papers quoted sources criticizing Yang's speech as “immature and mean.”5 Following China's response to Yang, the American media establishment weighed in, characterizing the Chinese reaction as hateful and in contradiction to free speech norms.6 *209 But it is often too easy for Western society to paint a foreign legal culture with one broad stroke of the brush. For instance, in September of the same year “[t]he heads of ten [Chinese] universities issued a joint statement” that condemned “recent abuses” of freedom of expression on college campuses.7 To be sure, university officials and students alike indicated that state regulation of speech “undoubtedly violate the right of students and teachers to freely discuss politics inside campus.”8 And, according to the P.R.C.'s Ministry of Education, students have the right to be “aware of the major issues concerning the reform and development of schools, [to] provide [] opinions and suggestions on school affairs, and participate[] in democratic supervision.”9 While Western media outlets characterized the Chinese response to Yang as nationalistic and in contravention of free speech norms, this was an overly simplistic view of the issue.10 In fact, it is clear that many in the Chinese establishment believe that free expression is a fundamental right on college campuses.11 However, like all rights in China, expression and speech are limited by traditional Confucian values.12 For instance, a central tenant of Confucian philosophy is to avoid disrupting Li13 meaning that members of a Confucian society should strive to conform their behavior to protect the order of society and safeguard superior-inferior relationship dynamics.14 Hence, while the American media interpreted China's response to Yang as being part of an anti-free speech culture,15 the reality is much more complex.16 In fact, the Chinese response was likely not rooted in anti-free speech sentiment at all but rather in the Confucian understanding that Yang had not acted in accordance with Li when she insulted China and disturbed the national order.17 Hence, what *210 appeared to be an invidious reaction to some in the West was merely the embodiment of fundamental Confucian values by Chinese commentators.18 Yang's story and the response it garnered from the West demonstrate the importance of understanding the legal tradition of a society before conducting an analysis of a particular regime.19 To be sure, understanding a legal regime's underlying tradition can inform a legal analysis, providing clarity to the goals promulgated by laws and the values that those laws safeguard.20 Yang's story also highlights drastically different views when it comes to student speech and expression on campus.21 Therefore, to gain a better understanding of speech and expression on foreign college campuses, this Article reviews the student speech regulations of three different legal systems: China, Saudi Arabia, and Germany. Specifically, this Article analyzes the aforementioned legal regimes in light of their respective traditions; by doing so, it sheds light on student expression in different legal systems. As a background, Part II of this Article discusses the legal traditions of China, Saudi Arabia, and Germany respectively, laying an appropriate framework to analyze student speech regulations.22 Specifically, this Part reviews the basic legal traditions of each nation, the evolution of these traditions, and the values embraced under each system.23 Part III reviews the relevant laws regulating student speech and expression on college campuses.24 In addition, Part III determines the interests and values that each legal tradition--through its regulations--seeks to safeguard.25 In Part IV, this Article compares the three legal systems and highlights the *211 different values and goals embraced by each tradition.26 Finally, Part V concludes by articulating the necessity for using comparative law when analyzing foreign legal regimes.27",
    "conclusion": "China, Saudi Arabia, and Germany have each implemented distinct regulations for managing student speech.239 While their methods for regulating speech differ in a variety of ways, this Article demonstrates that these differences are rooted in much more than mere policy choices. Rather, these differences stem from underlying legal traditions with inherent variations in history, values, and goals. To be sure, even when the regulations of the three states at issue prohibited similar types of student speech, the underlying goals behind the similarities differed dramatically. It is this author’s hope that the Article has demonstrated the complexity that understanding a legal tradition can bring into an analysis of foreign law.",

    "abstract": "We offer the first large scale, multiple source analysis of the outcome of what may be the most extensive effort to selectively censor human expression ever implemented. To do this, we have devised a system to locate, download, and analyze the content of millions of social media posts originating from nearly 1,400 different social media services all over China before the Chinese government is able to find, evaluate, and censor (i.e., remove from the Internet) the subset they deem objectionable. Using modern computer-assisted text analytic methods that we adapt to and validate in the Chinese language, we compare the substantive content of posts censored to those not censored over time in each of 85 topic areas. Contrary to previous understandings, posts with negative, even vitriolic, criticism of the state, its leaders, and its policies are not more likely to be censored. Instead, we show that the censorship program is aimed at curtailing collective action by silencing comments that represent, reinforce, or spur social mobilization, regardless of content. Censorship is oriented toward attempting to forestall collective activities that are occurring now or may occur in the future-and, as such, seem to clearly expose government intent.",
    "conclusion": "The new data and methods we offer seem to reveal highly detailed information about the interests of the Chinese people, the Chinese censorship program, and the Chinese government over time and within different issue areas. These results also shed light on an enormously secretive government program designed to suppress information, as well as on the interests, intentions, and goals of the Chinese leadership. The evidence suggests that when the leadership allowed social media to flourish in the country, they also allowed the full range of expression of negative and positive comments about the state, its policies, and its leaders. As a result, government policies sometimes look as bad, and leaders can be as embarrassed, as is often the case with elected politicians in democratic countries, but, as they seem to recognize, looking bad does not threaten their hold on power so long as they manage to eliminate discussions associated with events that have collective action potential-where a locus of power and control, other than the government, influences the behaviors of masses of Chinese people. With respect to this type of speech, the Chinese people are individually free but collectively in chains. Much research could be conducted on the implications of this governmental strategy; as a spur to this research, we offer some initial speculations here. For one, so long as collective action is prevented, social media can be an excellent way to obtain effective measures of the views of the populace about specific public policies and experiences with the many parts of Chinese government and the performance of public officials. As such, this “loosening” up on the constraints on public expression may, at the same time, be an effective governmental tool in learning how to satisfy, and ultimately mollify, the masses. From this perspective, the surprising empirical patterns we discover may well be a theoretically optimal strategy for a regime to use social media to maintain a hold on power. For example, Dimitrov (Reference Dimitrov2008) argues that regimes collapse when its people stop bringing grievances to the state, since it is an indicator that the state is no longer regarded as legitimate. Similarly, Egorov, Guriev, and Sonin (Reference Egorov, Guriev and Sonin2009) argue that dictators with low natural resource endowments allow freer media in order to improve bureaucratic performance. By extension, this suggests that allowing criticism, as we found the Chinese leadership does, may legitimize the state and help the regime maintain power. Indeed, Lorentzen (Reference Lorentzen2012) develops a formal model in which an authoritarian regimes balance media openness with regime censorship in order to minimize local corruption while maintaining regime stability. Perhaps the formal theory community will find ways of improving their theories after conditioning on our empirical results. More generally, beyond the findings of this article, the data collected represent a new way to study China and different dimensions of Chinese politics, as well as facets of comparative politics more broadly. For the study of China, our approach sheds light on authoritarian resilience, center-local relations, subnational politics, international relations, and Chinese foreign policy. By examining what events are censored at the national level versus a subnational level, our approach indicates some areas where local governments can act autonomously. Additionally, by clearly revealing government intent, our approach allows an examination of the differences between the priorities of various subnational units of government. Because we can analyze social media and censorship in the content of real-world events, this approach is able to reveal insights into China's international relations and foreign policy. For example, do displays of nationalism constrain the government's foreign policy options and activities? Finally, China's censorship apparatus can be thought of as one of the input institutions. Nathan (Reference Nathan2003) identifies as an important source of authoritarian resilience, and the effectiveness and capabilities of the censorship apparatus may shed light on the CCP's regime institutionalization and longevity. In the context of comparative politics, our work could directly reveal information about state capacity as well as shed light on the durability of authoritarian regimes and regime change. Recent work on the role of Internet and social media in the Arab spring (Ada et al. Reference Ada, Farrell, Lync, Sides and Freelon2012; Bellin Reference Bellin2012) debate the exact role played by these technologies in organizing collective action and motivating regional diffusion, but consistently highlight the relevance of these technological innovations on the longevity of authoritarian regimes worldwide. Edmond (Reference Edmond2012) models how the increase in information sources (e.g., Internet, social media) will be bad for a regime unless the regime has economies of scale in controlling information sources. While Internet and social media in general have smaller economies of scale, because of how China devolves the bulk of censorship responsibility to Internet content providers, the regime maintains large economies of scale in the face of new technologies. China, as a relatively rich and resilient authoritarian regime, with a sophisticated and effective censorship apparatus, is probably being watched closely by autocrats from around the world. Beyond learning the broad aims of the Chinese censorship program, we seem to have unearthed a valuable source of continuous time information on the interests of the Chinese people and the intentions and goals of the Chinese government. Although we illustrated this with time series in 85 different topic areas, the effort could be expanded to many other areas chosen ex ante or even discovered as online communities form around new subjects over time. The censorship behavior we observe may be predictive of future actions outside the Internet (see Appendix C), is informative even when the traditional media is silent, and would likely serve a variety of other scholarly and practical uses in government policy and business relations. Along the way, we also developed methods of computer-assisted text analysis that we demonstrate work well in the Chinese language and adapted it to this application. These methods would seem to be of use far beyond our specific application. We also conjecture that our data collection procedures, text analysis methods, engineering infrastructure, theories, and overall analytic and empirical strategies might be applicable in other parts of the world that suppress freedom of the press.",

    "abstract": "Authoritarian leaders around the world often fight against corruption in an effort to win public support. Conventional wisdom holds that this strategy works because leaders can signal their benevolent intentions by removing corrupt officials. We argue that fighting against corruption can undermine regime support. By revealing scandals of corrupt officials, corruption investigations can alter citizens' beliefs about public officials and lead to disenchantment about political institutions. We test this argument by examining how China's current anti-corruption campaign has changed citizens' public support for the government and the Communist Party. We analyze the results of two original surveys conducted before and during the campaign, and employ a difference-in-differences strategy to show that corruption investigations, at the margin, suppress respondents' support for the central government and party. We also examine our respondents' prior and posterior beliefs, and the results support our updating mechanism.",
    "conclusion": "Corruption is a global disease: it impedes economic growth, increases inequality, and erodes political legitimacy (Bardhan, Reference Bardhan1997; Seligson, Reference Seligson2002). Although some countries establish independent institutions, such as anti-corruption agencies or a judiciary, to control corruption, many resort to periodic campaigns to crack down on corruption. Intensive corruption investigations, however, might undermine regime support. The leaders of the campaign can still benefit, for example by eliminating their enemies and consolidating their power, but the institutions they lead have to pay a public opinion cost. (Although observers frequently state that the anti-corruption campaign made Xi Jinping popular, there are no approval ratings for individual leaders in China, so we cannot determine what the public actually thinks of Xi.) To our knowledge, this is the first quasi-experimental evidence of how corruption investigations affect regime support in an authoritarian regime. Using the case of China's current anti-corruption campaign, we show that citizens update their beliefs about public officials based on new information revealed during such campaigns. The more corruption the campaign reveals, the more it suppresses citizen support for the regime. Our findings reveal a bitter irony: corruption negatively impacts regime support, but fighting corruption is no panacea. In terms of public opinion, the cure may be as bad as the disease.

    "abstract": "Research shows that government-controlled media is an effective tool for authoritarian regimes to shape public opinion. Does government-controlled media remain effective when it is required to support changes in positions that autocrats take on issues? Existing theories do not provide a clear answer to this question, but we often observe authoritarian governments using government media to frame policies in new ways when significant changes in policy positions are required. By conducting an experiment that exposes respondents to government-controlled media-in the form of TV news segments-on issues where the regime substantially changed its policy positions, we find that by framing the same issue differently, government-controlled media moves respondents to adopt policy positions closer to the ones espoused by the regime regardless of individual predisposition. This result holds for domestic and foreign policy issues, for direct and composite measures of attitudes, and persists up to 48 hours after exposure.",
    "conclusion": "Through this experiment, we study whether authoritarian regimes can use government-controlled media to re-frame policy issue and change public opinion toward policies. From existing theory, we identify reasons why this may or may not be possible. Our experimental results suggest that when authoritarian regimes need to change their position on an issue, they can use government-controlled media to provide new frames for the issue and effectively shift public attitudes if they can achieve mainstream consensus, preventing alternative frames and contextual information from being voiced. Specifically, we find that government-controlled media, which frames domestic and foreign policy issues in different ways, moves respondents to adopt policy positions closer to the position, including opposing positions, espoused in government media. We find this to be the case whether we use direct or composite measures of attitudes, and we find that framing effects persist up to 48 hours after exposure. Importantly, we find that different frames are effective regardless of individual predispositions. Both those who have pro-market and those who have pro-state preferences with regard to economic policy become more likely to support market-led reform of SOEs when they are exposed to a frame about the importance of efficiency, and both those who hold pro-market and those who hold pro-state economic preferences become more likely to support state-led reform of SOEs when they are exposed to a frame about the role of SOEs in serving public interests. Both those who are nationalist and those who are anti-nationalist become more likely to support dovish foreign policy when such policies are framed in terms of mutual prosperity, and respondents with differing predispositions toward nationalism all become more likely to support hawkish foreign policy when such policies are framed in terms of sovereignty and territorial integrity. Finally, after controlling for predisposition, we find that those with higher levels of political knowledge are sometimes more influenced by framing effects than those with lower levels of political knowledge. This aligns with existing theories that knowledge increases the availability and comprehensibility of frames to individuals after accounting for predisposition. While our results on predisposition diverge from the bulk of research on the role of predisposition as a moderator of government media and framing effects, these results align with previous theories that predict such a result when propagandists can dominate and control the media environment, suppressing competing frames and contextual information that could link predisposition to new messages from government media. Such a circumstance is extremely unlikely in any competitive media system, and hence unlikely in most democracies, but mainstream consensus is likely and indeed the reality in many authoritarian regimes where those in power effectively stifle alternative voices. Although not all authoritarian regimes can achieve such an outcome, there are numerous contemporaneous (e.g., China, Cuba, Iran, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Turkmenistan) and historical (Peru under Fujimori, U.S.S.R) examples of such regimes. This finding suggests that media market structure and context matter a great deal to understanding the boundaries of framing effects.",

    "abstract": "The Chinese government has long been suspected of hiring as many as 2 million people to surreptitiously insert huge numbers of pseudonymous and other deceptive writings into the stream of real social media posts, as if they were the genuine opinions of ordinary people. Many academics, and most journalists and activists, claim that these so-called 50c party posts vociferously argue for the government’s side in political and policy debates. As we show, this is also true of most posts openly accused on social media of being 50c. Yet almost no systematic empirical evidence exists for this claim or, more importantly, for the Chinese regime’s strategic objective in pursuing this activity. In the first large-scale empirical analysis of this operation, we show how to identify the secretive authors of these posts, the posts written by them, and their content. We estimate that the government fabricates and posts about 448 million social media comments a year. In contrast to prior claims, we show that the Chinese regime’s strategy is to avoid arguing with skeptics of the party and the government, and to not even discuss controversial issues. We show that the goal of this massive secretive operation is instead to distract the public and change the subject, as most of these posts involve cheerleading for China, the revolutionary history of the Communist Party, or other symbols of the regime. We discuss how these results fit with what is known about the Chinese censorship program and suggest how they may change our broader theoretical understanding of “common knowledge” and information control in authoritarian regimes.",
    "conclusion": "Academics and policymakers have long been focused on contested physical spaces, over which military wars have been or might be fought. For example, in the South China Sea, the Chinese regime is presently building artificial islands and the United States is conducting military exercises, both highly expensive shows of power. As important as this focus may be, we believe that scholars and policymakers should focus considerably more effort on the Chinese Internet and its information environment, which is a contested virtual space, one that may well be more important than many contested physical spaces. The relationship between the government and the people is defined in this space, and thus the world has a great interest in what goes on there. We believe that considerably more resources and research should be devoted to this area. Whatever the appropriate relationship between governments and their people, a reasonable position is that it be open and known. This is an area where academic researchers can help. By devoting great effort, they can open up this knowledge to the world. It is our hope that others follow up on the research reported here. More specifically, most journalists, activists, participants in social media, and some scholars have, until now, argued that the massive 50c party is devoted to engaging in argument that defends the regime, its leaders, and their policies. Our evidence indicates the opposite-that the 50c party engages in almost no argument of any kind and is instead devoted primarily to cheerleading for the state, symbols of the regime, or the revolutionary history of the Communist Party. We interpret these activities as the regime’s effort at strategic distraction from collective action, grievances, or general negativity, and so forth. It also appears that the 50c party is mostly composed of government employees contributing part time outside their regular jobs, not, as has been claimed, ordinary citizens paid piecemeal for their work. This, nevertheless, is still an enormous workforce that, we estimate, produces 448 million 50c posts per year. Their effectiveness appears maximized by the effort we found of them concentrating the posts into spikes at appropriate times and by directing about half of the posts to comments on government websites.",

These emails give explicit details of the work of numerous 50c accounts in this district. Although in the public domain and reported in the press (e.g., Henochowicz 2014; Sonnad 2014), the structure of the archive is complicated, too large to understand by traditional qualitative methods, and in formats (and attachments) far too diverse to make standard methods of automation feasible.

    "abstract": "With China-U.S. relations becoming simultaneously more integrated and complex, it is all the more important to understand the nature and determinants of reciprocal perceptions between Chinese and American publics. Using nationally representative, bi-national public opinion surveys, this article compares the attitudes of Chinese toward the U.S. with those of Americans toward China. The article gives primary attention to generalized attitudes toward each country but also studies domain-specific attitudes. The results suggest that Chinese hold more-favorable attitudes toward the U.S. than do Americans toward China. Chinese and Americans also differ on domain-specific issues. Chinese place greater importance on sovereignty issues and territorial disputes, while Americans give greater attention to universal values such as human rights and environmental degradation.",
    "conclusion": "Overall, the data revealed that substantial shares of Chinese and American respondents held positive attitudes toward the other country, although Chinese respondents held more-favorable attitudes toward America than Americans did toward China. However, attitudes varied according to the demographic attributes of the respondents. In China, older respondents held less-favorable attitudes toward America than younger Chinese. Better-educated Chinese respondents held more-favorable attitudes toward America than less-educated Chinese respondents. The educational gradient in America was reversed, so that better-educated Americans held less-favorable attitudes toward China. This finding agrees with the education-as-liberation thesis, in the sense that better-educated individuals are more in favor of liberal regimes than authoritarian regimes. The present article also found that Chinese respondents were more likely to considered America as a rival than as a partner, whereas about equal shares of American respondents considered China as either a rival or a partner. While the authors were not able to examine which aspect of the threat (economic, military, or ideology) was more concerning due to data limitations, the analysis of domain-specific issues offers some clues. Results show that Chinese respondents were more concerned with China’s territorial disputes, such as issues regarding the South China Sea, Taiwan, and Tibet. The American respondents were more concerned with international rules and norms, such as human rights and climate change. These findings suggest that the two nations may diverge in their interests in dealing with each other. The Chinese government took a realist, rational approach to foreign affairs and emphasized issues regarding national interests. The U.S. approach to China is a mixture of realism and liberalism, which may direct Americans’ attention toward liberal norms. The top-of-mind association questionnaires further reveal that U.S. hegemonic power is the main source of America’s negative image in China. Americans’ image of China is composed in two parts: its ancient history/culture and economic development. These findings confirm multi-dimensionality of national image.",

    "abstract": "Critics see China’s social credit system (SCS) as a tool of surveillance and repression. Yet opinion surveys in China find considerable public support for the SCS. We explain this puzzle by focusing on citizens’ lack of knowledge regarding the repressive nature of digital surveillance in dictatorships, which can be attributed to (1) invisible and targeted repression associated with digital surveillance and (2) government propaganda and censorship further concealing its repressive potential. A field survey experiment on 750 college students in three Chinese regions shows that revealing the SCS’s repressive potential significantly reduces sup- port for the system, but emphasizing its social-order-maintenance function does not increase support. Observational evidence from the field survey and a nationwide survey of 2,028 Chinese netizens show that the support is higher if citizens knew about the SCS through state media. Our findings highlight the role of information and framing in shaping public opinion on digital surveillance.",
    "conclusion": "China’s SCS was created to enforce contracts and maintain social order, but it has great potential for political repression given the huge amount of citizen information it integrates and the ease with which it punishes violators by lowering their “social credits.” This article argues that public support for the SCS is partly due to citizens’ lack of information concerning the SCS’s repressive potential. This information problem is caused by the milder, less visible repression that the SCS entails and is exacerbated by government information control in dictatorships. Using a field survey experiment, we show that respondents are not more supportive of the SCS when receiving information about its order-maintenance role but largely decrease their support when knowing its repressive function. Using observational data from the same field survey and a nationwide online survey, we find that citizens are more likely to support the SCS when their knowledge about it is from state media outlets. We further conduct text analysis of state media reports and show that the government portrays the SCS in a very positive way, with little mention of its repressive function. The evidence together highlights the role of information control in public support for the SCS in China. The theory and findings have important implications for digital surveillance. They suggest that the government can hide the repressive potential of digital surveillance under its security-maintenance function to garner public support. This problem is more serious in dictatorships, not only because of government propaganda and censorship but also because citizens in societies with underdeveloped legal systems crave better enforcement of social contracts, and a centralized information collection and enforcement platform like the SCS in China meets the demand. Nevertheless, an important takeaway from this article is that public support for digital surveillance is not very stable in dictatorships.18 As we illustrated in the field survey experiment, a simple reminder of the SCS’s repressive function can substantially reduce citizens’ support. It is not easy for the government to recover the reduced support by showing the social benefits of digital surveillance because citizens have already been overwhelmed by the government’s positive framing. Although potential backlash from citizens may not stop the government from expanding surveillance and repression, it imposes some costs on the government. Citizens’ awareness of repression may also lead to preference falsification (Kuran 1991), rendering state surveillance ineffective. Thus, rational dictators would have an incentive to keep the level of repression low in order to maintain a well-functioning surveillance state.",

      "authorsDataDescription": "A field survey experiment on 750 college students in three Chinese regions shows that revealing the SCS’s repressive potential significantly reduces support for the system, but emphasizing its social-order-maintenance function does not increase support. Observational evidence from the field survey and a nationwide survey of 2,028 Chinese netizens show that the support is higher if citizens knew about the SCS through state media. We use observational data to explore the role of information on citizen’s support for the SCS. State-run news media-China’s propaganda machine-provide abundant information on the SCS’s social-order-maintenance functions but conceal its repressive potential. Using the aforementioned field survey and a nationwide survey of 2,028 Chinese internet users, we find that citizens are more likely to support the SCS if they obtained information about the SCS from state media instead of other sources.",

    "abstract": "We develop a theory of how an authoritarian regime interactively uses information manipulation, such as propaganda or censorship, and policy improvement to maintain social stability. The government can depict the status quo policy more popularly supported than it actually is, while at the same time please citizens directly by enacting a costly reform. We show that the government’s ability of making policy concessions reduces its incentive to manipulate information and improves its credibility. Anticipating a higher chance of policy concessions and less information manipulation, citizens are more likely to believe the government-provided information and support the regime. Our model provides an explanation for the puzzling fact that reform coexists with selective information disclosure in authoritarian countries like China.",
    "conclusion": "We develop a model in which an authoritarian government interactively uses information manipulation and reform to prevent citizens’ collective action against the regime. The two citizens’ incentives to join a protest depend on their beliefs about a societal fundamental and the government’s policy. We show that the government’s exerting efforts to reform serves two purposes: (1) it pleases the citizens directly and (2) it reveals the government’s private information on the (un)popularity of the status quo policy. Information manipulation, on the other hand, may reshape the citizens’ beliefs of the social fundamental and discourage them from joining collective action, granted that reform sometimes actually takes place. We characterize the equilibrium level of information manipulation and policy changes. We show that, in equilibrium, the degree of information manipulation depends on the government’s ability to make policy concessions. This is because a high ability to adjust polices reduces the cost of revealing the truth. Expecting the information to be more credible, the citizens are more likely to abstain from participating in collective action when they are told that the reform policy is unpopular. In other words, occasional policy concessions lends credibility to government-provided information, which in turn reduces the risks of collective action. We also consider the optimal institutional design with which the government can maximize its expected payoff by committing to a set of rules that ex ante specify its strategies. We show that, when commitment is possible (e.g., by institutionalizing certain government functions), the government always uses a mixture of information manipulation and reform. Our model sheds lights on the puzzling fact that authoritarian regimes, such as China, control the information their citizens receive through propaganda and censorship, whereas at the same time make policy concessions to them.",

    "abstract": "We study the impact of anticorruption efforts on firm performance, exploiting an unanticipated corruption crackdown in China’s Heilongjiang province in 2004. We compare firms in the affected regions with those in other inland regions before and after the crackdown. Our main finding is an overall negative impact of the crackdown on firm productivity and entry rates. Furthermore, these negative impacts are mainly experienced by private and foreign firms, while state-owned firms are mostly unaffected. We present evidence concerning two potential explanations for our findings. First, the corruption crackdown may have limited bribery opportunities that helped private firms operate. Second, the corruption crackdown may have interfered with personal connections between private firms and government officials to a greater extent than institutional connections between state-owned firms and the government. Overall, our findings suggest that corruption crackdowns may not restore efficiency in the economy, but instead lead to worse economic outcomes, at least in the short run (JEL L2, M1, O1).",
    "conclusion": "This article examines the consequences of a large-scale corruption crackdown in Heilongjiang province in China around the year 2004. The unanticipated nature of this event allows us to examine the impact of a corruption crackdown on firms’ productivity and entry rates at sub-national levels. Using a comprehensive database on Chinese manufacturing firms, we compare Heilongjiang firms’ performance to firms in other inland provinces before and after the crackdown. We find that the crackdown had a substantial negative impact on Heilongjiang firms’ labor productivity and entry rates. More interestingly, private and foreign firms suffer the most, while the SOEs were unaffected.",

    "abstract": "Analyzing sentencing disparity calls for more calibrated measures to capture the nuances of judicial discretion within jurisdictions that adopt strict sentencing guidelines. This article uses an unconventional outcome variable, percent deviation, to investigate guideline digressions in a nested, multilevel model. Percent deviation is calculated based on the difference between the guidelines’ “arithmetic starting point” and the actual starting point that a judge adopts. Two equations were used to measure percent deviation from the arithmetic starting point before and after adjustment for guilty plea sentence reductions. Extracting data on drug trafficking cases from an open-source database from the Hong Kong Judiciary (n = 356), we illustrate how percent deviation can be employed as a measure of inter-judge disparity using hierarchical linear models (HLMs). Our findings suggest that approximately 8 to 10 percent of the deviation in sentence length can be attributed to judges’ differential sentencing behaviors. The deviation is affected by case characteristics as well as judicial characteristics. Due to the wide guideline ranges, departures from said guidelines’ ranges are not common. This indicates that the guideline ranges mask the deviation and inter-judge disparity that exist and recur.",
    "conclusion": "By modeling percent deviation through HLMs, this study was able to illustrate the presence of sentencing disparity and quantify the effect of inter-judge differences. Using percent deviation as an outcome variable, each case's sentence deviation could be directly measured and the collective disparity between judges compared. The use of percent deviation equations to measure sentence disparity is not limited to drug trafficking offenses or the Hong Kong context. These equations can be applied to a wide range of offenses and in a variety of jurisdictions given that sentencing guidelines are adopted and starting points for specific offense types are delineated.",

    "abstract": "The mass publicity of court decisions in China, this article argues, is part of the larger trend of the Chinese judiciary becoming increasingly centralized. The transparency reform enables the Supreme People’s Court to control the information reporting process within the judicial hierarchy and rein in local courts through public scrutiny. Interestingly, local courts responded strategically, making disclosure far poorer than required. Meanwhile, the central government has dispatched more cadres to local courts, and these cadres are associated with more than a 10 percent higher disclosure rate of judicial decisions, suggesting that centralization of personnel is adopted to effectively implement the centralized policy. The transparency reform, coinciding with reforms in other domains, embodies an important shift toward a more centralized judicial sector in China.",
    "conclusion": "Perplexingly, China runs the largest judicial online publicity venue in the world, and this venue is expanding through the inclusion of millions of court decisions on an annual basis. The mass publicity of court decisions, as this article shows, is part of the larger trend of the Chinese judiciary becoming increasingly centralized. The SPC carries out transparency reform in order to rein in local courts through public scrutiny, while local courts responded strategically, rendering disclosure of decisions far from the level that the central government requires. On the other hand, the central government has dispatched increasing amounts of judicial cadres to local courts, and provincial judicial cadres dispatched by the central government improve the disclosure rate and implementation of central policy. The transparency reform, coinciding with reforms in many other domains, such as the centralized funding and concentrated personnel management, signals the subtle but important shift toward centralization in the judicial sector of China.",

This metric was used to roughly approximate the caseload of judges in different provinces. It is hypothesized that, the heavier the caseload, the less capable a court will be able to handle extra online publicity tasks (i.e. uploading its decisions to the SPC website), other things being equal. Admittedly, a better metric for caseload would be the average number of cases decided by each judge. But the data on the number of judges in each province are unavailable to the public.

    "abstract": "The “law and finance” paradigm posits that legal institutions play a crucial role in financial development; however, China has long been considered an exception. This study challenges that assumption by examining how improvements in the judiciary affect financial development in China. Using a quasi-natural experiment (i.e., staggered difference-in-difference estimation) over a twenty-year period, we find that the establishment of specialized financial adjudication institutions (i.e., financial courts and tribunals) in certain prefecture-level cities significantly reduces financing constraints for local listed companies. Further heterogeneity tests show that these effects are more pronounced among private enterprises, small and medium-sized enterprises, and companies in the central and western regions. Through the analysis of representative practices and interviews with relevant judges and enterprises, we find that China's financial judiciary demonstrates efficiency and proactiveness. Additionally, political considerations enable courts to regulate finance and maintain stability, improving the local financial legal environments and reducing transaction costs for market participants. By investigating the causal relationship between judicial reforms and financial development, our findings provide new insights into the “law and finance” theory and offer policy implications for addressing financial development gaps and promoting financial inclusion in emerging markets.",
    "conclusion": "Based on our study's findings, several key conclusions emerge. First, provided that other conditions remain constant, the establishment of specialized financial adjudication institutions in China has been found to alleviate local financing constraints, thereby contributing to financial prosperity in these regions. Second, our analysis indicates that these positive effects are particularly significant for listed companies in central China, as well as for privately-owned and small to medium-sized enterprises within the listed company sector, underscoring the role of these institutions in promoting financial inclusion. Third, qualitative analysis suggests that specialized adjudication institutions in China contribute to investor confidence and market integrity through efficient and substantive protection of investors' rights. They also enhance the regulatory function of financial adjudication and improve the overall rule of law environment. These factors collectively optimize the financial transaction environment, reduce costs, and increase market participation, ultimately enhancing financial development in specific regions. In terms of policy implications, our study suggests that while not every region may be ready to establish financial courts or tribunals immediately, cultivating a cadre of specialized judges with expertise in financial adjudication could be a viable interim measure. These judges could form specialized teams to efficiently resolve financial disputes and contribute to financial sector stability. This experience is not only relevant to China but can also be applied to other emerging markets facing similar developmental challenges. The findings of this study engender several expansive thinking. First, it is essential to adopt a developmental perspective on the relationship between legal origins and judicial characteristics, especially in the era of global legal system convergence (Pogrebennyk, 2014). Just as common law systems have incorporated aspects of statutory law, China's judicial adjudication within the civil law tradition has gradually acquired particular characteristics resembling those of common law systems (Liu et al., 2021). The establishment of specialized financial adjudication institutions in China serves as compelling evidence of this trend. Second, it is imperative to reassess the relationship between China's unique context and traditional Western theories. While researchers often emphasize China's exceptionalism, it is equally crucial to recognize the universality of China's developmental experiences compared to other countries and regions. Third, a nuanced understanding of the characteristics of China's judicial system is warranted. While conventional wisdom may view the influence of economic and political factors on China's judiciary as something negative, this study suggests that “political embeddedness” in the financial domain may have positive implications, such as mitigating financial risks and maintaining regional financial stability, thereby creating a conducive environment for financial transactions. The limitations of this study need to be acknowledged. First, due to constraints in data availability, the dependent variable in this research is limited to the financing constraints of listed companies. This approach may not fully capture the financing difficulties faced by small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which are often more severe and prevalent. Interestingly, our heterogeneity analysis in Table 6 reveals that even among listed companies, the mitigating effect of financial courts and tribunals on financing constraints is significantly stronger for smaller firms. This suggests that our results may underestimate the true impact of financial courts and tribunals on alleviating financing constraints in the broader economy, particularly for SMEs. From a methodological standpoint, this potential underestimation strengthens our findings: If we observe significant effects using data that likely understates the true impact, it implies that the actual effect of financial courts and tribunals on financing constraints in the broader economy could be even more pronounced. Nevertheless, if feasible, future studies could broaden the scope by extending the research subjects from listed companies to non-listed companies, particularly SMEs. Additionally, it may be beneficial to incorporate more indicators to assess the level of financial development in specific regions more comprehensively. For example, changes in the number of financial enterprises in specific regions, as well as fluctuations in the number and business volume of commercial banks. Second, concerning the mechanism explanation of empirical results, this paper primarily adopts a qualitative approach, including case studies and interviews. Future research could further verify the mechanisms through which specialized financial adjudication institutions promote financial development using more precise quantitative methods. At the micro level, the analysis could utilize data extracted from judicial documents (such as the duration from case acceptance to resolution) to assess whether financial courts or tribunals expedite dispute resolution. At the macro level, statistical data, including the number of regional financial regulations, business environment indices, and specialized surveys, could be employed to examine whether the establishment of financial courts and tribunals enhances the local financial transaction environment and market order.",

However, the PRC's proposed minor mode regulation is neither an extreme departure from the types of restrictions neighboring countries in East Asia have imposed on children's screen time and internet use, nor its own previous regulations in this area. As such, the proposed regulation is unlikely to have violated a norm of customary international law against restricting children's internet use. Similarly, although international instruments like the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights guarantee a universal right of expression, which arguably includes an implied right to the internet, the proposed Chinese regulation is not likely to be deemed violative of either of these instruments because of ambiguities within them as to how states are meant to weigh children's rights against their protection. This conclusion is bolstered by the competing provisions of the Convention on the Rights of the Child about protecting children's fundamental rights while also ensuring their health and wellbeing. As such, the PRC's Draft Minor Mode Guidelines are likely to pass without facing significant legal challenges domestically or internationally.",
    "conclusion": "The health and development problems associated with children's excessive screen time and overuse of the internet are real,228 and governments have an affirmative duty to make an effort to protect children from these harms.229 The PRC's Draft Minor Mode Guidelines represent the latest development in a smattering of regulation in this area in the country over the past several years. And while minor mode appears to be a more facially restrictive method of reducing children's screen time than the previous Chinese regulations, it is well-founded in Chinese law. Furthermore, as displayed by the examples of South Korea, Japan, and Taiwan, China's neighbors have all attempted to resolve this issue in a number of ways which, despite differing slightly in substance, are not clearly less restrictive than the PRC's Draft Minor Mode Guidelines. Finally, while various rights of children are certainly implicated by all of the internet use restrictions mentioned in this Comment, current versions of relevant international instruments like the UDHR, the ICCPR, and the CRC all fail to provide a meaningful answer on how governments should balance children's fundamental human rights with protecting children from the real harm that internet overuse can cause to their physical, mental, and emotional wellbeing and development. While this Comment does not take a stance on how international institutions might accomplish this, or on whether they should do so at all, the analysis above depicts a significant gap in the *258 current framework of international human rights when it comes to children and competing interests. As governments continue to adopt new ways of approaching this issue, these ambiguities will continue to lead to confusion and a lack of uniform application of these treaties. The PRC's Draft Minor Mode Guidelines, even at the draft stage, rest on solid legal ground, both domestically and internationally, and they represent a regulatory trend that may continue across the globe as the internet continues to become more and more integral to daily life.230 If there is an international right to the internet embedded in the right to freedom of expression of either customary international law or in one of the international instruments analyzed above, an international body needs to make that clear or at the very least engage with how internet use restrictions for minors interact with such a right.",

    "abstract": "Law and politics are closely related. The differences and changes in political factors have direct and profound impacts on law. As a fundamental political element, the political power structure basically has two typical forms, namely, a centralized system and a decentralized system. A centralized system means concentration of political power in both horizontal and vertical dimensions: horizontally, power is held in the hands of chief officials, while vertically, in the central government. By contrast, in a decentralized system, power is dispersed in a manner of pluralism in both dimensions. Through an empirical study of the history of early imperial law, this article compares the different facets of the judicial process that were under the influence of these two typical forms of power structure in ancient societies, tests the thesis in various forms, and thus explains the close relationship between law and politics. The Chinese Qin-Han and Roman Empires co-existed and developed in parallel at the two ends of the Eurasia continent, leaving remarkable legacies on human civilizations, including political and legal systems. Meanwhile, the Roman regime, especially during its imperial period, covers a vast territory comparable to that of early imperial China and shares similarities in terms of size, population, and level of economic development. Therefore, these two systems are ideally comparable in the analysis of causation between politics and law as it is easier to control variables by excluding potential influences from factors other than the political system, which is presumably a key variable in this study. Due to the differences in geographical environments, historical development, and political ideas, the political power structures in early imperial China and the Roman Republic (509 B.C.E.--27 B.C.E) can be taken as the representative institutions, respectively, of centralization and decentralization. The former regime consists of the Qin (221 B.C.E.--206 B.C.E.) and Han (202 B.C.E.--220 C.E.) dynasties. Meanwhile, the Roman *627 system in different periods had significantly more diverse characteristics: deviating from the Republican decentralized system, the Principate (27 B.C.E.--284 C.E.) appeared as a transitional form towards centralization, while the Dominate (284-565) turned to be a quasi-centralized system, which resembles that of early imperial China in many respects. These various patterns along the spectrum are used as ideal examples to verify the impact of political changes upon law and its enforcement. Different political power structures give rise to their corresponding styles of state actions and methods of allocating social resources and thus affect law and judicial practice.1 Under centralized systems such as the Qin-Han Chinese regimes, political power is in the hands of chief officials in a locality, controlled vertically by the central government under the absolutism of monarch. It leads to a strong and active state, a hierarchical control structure, and a mechanism where chief officials take full responsibility. This system generates a strong ability to mobilize and allocate resources, raises a large team of professional bureaucrats, and provides sufficient support for an active state-led judicial system, especially the significant costs required for criminal law enforcement and document-based superior review. By contrast, in a decentralized system, political power is dispersed in both horizontal and vertical dimensions; hence, the government is relatively weak and passive, and the capacity to mobilize resources is limited. Accordingly, governance is typically based on social participation and power balance, which gives rise to party-dominated adversarialism in judicial practice. Adopting the methodology of ideal-type analysis on law and politics,2 this article explores the key elements in the judicial process, including participants, procedural settings, and law application, in different political settings and analyzes the impact of different political power structures in these fields.",
    "conclusion": "As far as the typology of political systems is concerned, the concept of a *642 centralized system is often considered a synonym of “oriental despotism,”95 a phrase that implies a negative connotation by nature. When comparing centralization with decentralization, it is likely to turn accordingly to a contrast between authoritarianism and liberalism. Nevertheless, a comparison from a social science perspective without ideological bias will shed new light on the understanding of various systems. Firstly, centralization and decentralization are ideal types that do not inherently carry the weight of value judgments. Secondly, the dichotomy of the two types does not mean they are definitely against each other or mutually exclusive. The systems in reality often have certain degrees of hybridity and relativity, as seen in the Roman Principate and Dominate. Many systems in practice, fit in the middle of the spectrum between the two ends of the ideal types. Moreover, the selection and shift between the two types in the real world are the results of social rationality, not necessarily corresponding to certain points on the hierarchical scale of values. Thus, it is not appropriate to label the continental system as inferior simply because it exhibits more characteristics of centralization compared to the Anglo-American system and vice versa, nor is it plausible to claim inherent superiority for the former. Meanwhile, politics is merely one determinant of legal systems, as many other external factors have varying degrees of influence on law. The ideas and mechanisms of law also have stability and inertia, and they are not easily changed only in accordance with the political structure in the short term. For example, in Roman Dominate, when political centralization significantly increased, unlike the general trend of convergence with Qin-Han China in many other aspects of law, there was no significant change in the philosophical understanding of law. This can be attributed to the influence of Christianity on the conception of law and the strong coherence and stability of ideological beliefs. Additionally, lawyers still widely participated in the judicial process as a relatively stable professional group. The role of other factors, however, does not affect the general understanding of the close relationship between politics and law, as explained in this article, if we consider the changes from a long-term and comprehensive perspective.",

    "abstract": "The first personal bankruptcy regime in Mainland China celebrated its second anniversary on March 1, 2023. An empirical assessment of the law in action during these first two years reveals some troubling deviations from the early promises of the new law on the books. In the first year, a handful of judges were charged with an arduous in-person review process for over 1,000 applicants, and they accepted only twenty-five for case initiation. In the second year, initial case review was delegated to an administrative body--an important efficiency enhancement that tripled the number of opened cases. Nonetheless, most debtors continue to be dissuaded from applying at all, and hundreds of applications have been rejected, in part on the non-statutory grounds that the court is admitting only business-related cases. Moreover, the default gateway of liquidation-and-discharge has been successfully used only once, secretly relegated to “last resort” status. Debtors are effectively limited to proposing that creditors accept a payment plan offering full repayment of principal within five years, and creditors have rejected many such plans. While most admitted restructuring cases have led to confirmed plans, many of these “successes” are built on very shaky foundations that portend likely struggle and repeat default ahead. The new system, thus, seems to be operating in quite a skewed fashion: admitting only a very small fraction of applicants and offering relief on narrow and demanding grounds. This is a disappointing abandonment of the textual promise of broad, standardized relief consistent with international best practices. As national authorities in China (and elsewhere) consider adopting a country-wide personal bankruptcy law, Shenzhen's experience illustrates the challenges of striking the right balance between relief and responsibility in personal insolvency regulation.",
    "conclusion": "The law in action in Shenzhen's groundbreaking new personal bankruptcy system has thus far dashed the hopes of most aspiring applicants. While the law in books could support a world-class insolvency relief system, the Shenzhen Bankruptcy Court's constricted and conservative interpretation has rendered it largely a dead letter. Effectively the opposite of the consumer bankruptcy regime in Taiwan, the Shenzhen regime in operation cannot be called a “consumer” bankruptcy system; it is only a partial “personal” bankruptcy regime restricted to current or former entrepreneurs (with a sufficient current connection to Shenzhen). Indeed, it is scarcely a “bankruptcy” regime at all, but rather primarily a mechanism for facilitating negotiation of mild interest and penalty concessions. A system that requires (1) exceptionally hopeless insolvency for standard liquidation-and-discharge relief, and (2) a promise of 100% principal repayment for a reorganization plan is not consistent with international standards for personal bankruptcy.150 Such a system is destined to produce heartache and failure. Many more debtors need to be admitted to a proper personal bankruptcy hospital, and treatment should be offered to most on a standard basis, not only the extremes of almost-dead patients and negotiated prescriptions for those who need only mild relief. Shenzhen has sketched out a good framework in its personal bankruptcy regulation, but judicial and administrative officials would be well-served to go back to the drawing board.",

    "abstract": "How do authoritarian states build the legal infrastructure of private law (e.g., property rights, contract enforcement) necessary to support efficient markets? Authoritarians typically undersupply this infrastructure due to an “authoritarian’s legal dilemma”: how to create a judiciary that would supply and only supply private law. If a judiciary is sufficiently strong and independent to support private law, it cannot credibly commit not to constrain the autocrat by strengthening public law (e.g., citizen rights, constitution). We argue that China has devised a novel solution to this dilemma: partially outsourcing the provision of private law to key private actors. In China’s 700-million-user e-commerce market, online trading platforms (e.g., Taobao) have privately supplied strong legal infrastructure to enforce contracts, prevent fraud, and settle disputes. Such platforms both enforce and create private law through rule experimentation. This digital route to legal development is politically viable and potentially generalizable to other states.",
    "conclusion": "In this paper, we explore the authoritarian’s legal dilemma, which refers to the desire to develop private law to govern commerce without creating an independent judicial system capable of challenging the state. In the case of law, Chinese style, the government has opportunistically if subtly embraced the development of law by key private actors. Online market platforms are central to this process, building digital online economic institutions that evolve rapidly and can easily be scaled up. These platforms hence have established a national market with legal infrastructure that the central government has found it difficult to provide. Assuming that this experiment succeeds in some form, China will have provided a novel solution to the authoritarian’s legal dilemma - allowing the creation of an online system of private law that is difficult to expand into public law. In fact, the rise of private legal systems in online markets may even delay the formal development of public law. The data accumulated from this private legal system makes it possible for the state to strengthen its surveillance apparatus. Law, Chinese style is not without limitations. The outsourcing of legal development is still limited in scope (i.e., restricted to certain areas of private law). Taobao’s private legal system remains in the shadow of political power. Its existence still relies on maintaining a benign relationship with the state, although various costs of intervention can constrain the state’s arbitrary acts to some extent. Moreover, although Taobao’s private legal system is largely algorithm based, there is still room for corruption and nepotism between the users and the platform employees who enforce the rules. Competition among platforms can contain, but not eradicate, the potential abuse of power by business elites. Lastly, the emergence of law, Chinese style marks a partial shift from human enforcement to digital enforcement of market rules. While digital enforcement decreases the chance of human errors and manipulation, algorithms themselves are not free of problems such as algorithmic bias and interpretability issues. We are well aware of these limitations. By no means are we suggesting that law, Chinese style is a Pareto-efficient or normatively-superior approach to developing a legal market infrastructure. Nor do we contend that government-initiated legal reforms are unnecessary. Rather, we posit that law, Chinese style presents one of the few options to strike a balance between economic efficiency and political feasibility, which is important for legal development in authoritarian countries. Essentially, our theory proposes a “second-best institution,” which, according to Rodrik, is more appropriate for the developing world than the alleged “best-practice institutions,” since political barriers cannot be easily tackled in the short term. Importantly, law, Chinese style implies a new governance model, which we call “private governance under state oversight.” That is, in certain governance areas, the state can allow or even encourage multiple key private actors (e.g., online trading platforms) to provide competing, overlapping systems of private governance, among which citizens can choose at will; the state can then formalize the private rules that work best. Competition among private systems of governance is especially valuable for states where the governance deficit is rooted in the dearth of political competition. After all, most Chinese people cannot cast a vote or “vote with their feet,” yet they can “vote with clicks.” The key is that the state needs to prevent one single platform from becoming a state-franchised monopoly in order to keep the competition among platforms vibrant. This model draws wisdom from past claims that governance is not necessarily provided by centralized governments, and that competition among private providers of governance facilitates innovation and the discovery of new rules. This paper has broader implications. It sheds light on the main developments in Chinese politics in other realms. Beyond legal development (as discussed in this paper), Beijing has also outsourced political and coercive functions to private actors such as tech companies. For instance, censorship is often carried out by private social media platforms rather than the state. The Chinese state has also increasingly outsourced social functions. During the recent battle with the coronavirus, the Ministry of Civil Affairs openly requested tech companies such as Tencent and Alibaba to develop community epidemic control apps, and the companies quickly did so. The parallel state outsourcing activities in different realms indicate a crucial change in China’s state-private sector relations. Experimentation by internet platforms appears to be changing China’s legal, political, and economic foundations. Finally, this paper has implications for market and legal development for other countries. Many developing countries - especially authoritarian states - confront the same issue: political obstacles have impeded the development of strong rule of law in markets. With the global rise of online markets and institutions and the diffusion of online institutional practices across country borders, “law, Chinese style” may no longer be unique to China. Will state outsourcing to digital platforms become a generalizable path to legal development? It may hold the potential for such a transformation.",

    "abstract": "Why would one person facilitate a community member's evasion of the law, even when there is nothing tangible in it for themselves? In this article, I draw on stories in Chinese villages under the one-child policy to suggest that the lack of moral legitimacy in a particular law motivates people to help others overcome legal or policy restrictions, especially when there are existing connections and trust among them. It reveals the influential impact of law's moral legitimacy on people's responses to legal evasion and the relational nature of legal consciousness. An individual's existing connections with and trust in those who evade the law often reinforce the sense of obligation to take matters into one's own hands to help right the wrong that has been done to them. Nevertheless, the consequences of participating in such collusion may reshape expectations and obligations within the community, pushing law-evading citizens to minimize risks for those who are willing to facilitate their evasion of the law. The fluid nature of interpersonal relationships in Chinese society also means that when things go wrong, supportive members may in turn use their insider information against the law-evading citizen to seek revenge or teach them a lesson. In 1989, Mingna, a six-year-old girl, never had a good night's sleep. Mingna's mother was pregnant again after having four daughters. Officials from the township often raided in the middle of the night to arrest women with extra-plan pregnancies and their family members due to their violation of the one-child policy. Determined to have a son, Mingna's family spent the nights here and there with relatives who were willing to have them for a night or two. Mingna felt safer in the daytime, as she believed village fellows would watch out for them. Sometimes, the village cadres notified the family in advance to allow them some time to run away. “Village cadres and fellows are all our relatives to some extent. We all carry the same surname and interact with one another every day. People in this village were reluctant to report extra-plan pregnancies,” said Mingna. She emphasized that collusion between her family and village fellows was crucial to her family's success in having her younger brother.",
    "conclusion": "Stories of legal collusion under the one-child policy have demonstrated how relational legal consciousness is formed and sustained within social groups, even to the point where people are willing to facilitate others' evasion of the law. In general, people are prepared to take matters into their own hands to help their group members when the law is illegitimate. Legal collusion will most likely take place when two inseparable factors are both present: the law's lack of moral legitimacy; and a zijiren relationship between the colluding parties. The two factors are inextricably connected, and missing either of the two will significantly reduce the chance for legal collusion. In other words, an illegitimate law alone will not necessarily result in collusion when there are no zijiren relationships involved; and the existence of zijiren relationships alone does not guarantee legal collusion. At the same time, while those who evade the law can expect a certain level of protection from group members because of existing connections with them and the law's lack of moral legitimacy, they should never take kindness and support for granted. This is especially the case when the imposition of collective responsibility and financial incentives has the potential to unsettle preexisting expectations among community members. Those who evade the law have the responsibility to create opportunities for legal collusion by providing seemingly convincing evidence and absorbing the negative impacts themselves. Things become more complicated when there are more than two parties involved. For example, village fellows were simultaneously zijiren to the couple who evaded the law and the village cadre born and raised in the same village. A balance had to be reached when a particular zijiren's evasion of the law had a negative impact on another zijiren. This complexity reminds law and society scholars of the need to look beyond the relationship between the parties directly involved in legal collusion and pay close attention to other people who may be affected directly or indirectly. It is generally safe for an individual to assume some level of protection from zijiren when the individual puts in the effort to minimize the negative impact on other community members who help with the evasion of the illegitimate law. But things did not always work out as expected. After all, envy, disputes, and conflicts are inevitable in close communities such as small villages in rural Fujian. Community members can in turn use the insider information to report those who evade the law as a way to seek revenge, teach somebody a lesson, or even just for personal interests such as monetary rewards and promotions. Thus, people who evade a particular piece of morally illegitimate law should stay alert and try their best to avoid attention from community members. This study uses stories under the one-child policy to discuss the factors that contribute to legal collusion, the importance of taking responsibility and creating opportunities for other community members to participate in legal collusion, and the *2070 uncertainty of legal collusion due to the fluid nature of interpersonal relationships. The findings of the analysis of thin legal collusion in this article have broader implications within and outside Chinese societies. The article offers a theoretical framework to discuss the reasons behind people's tolerance and facilitation of other people's evasion of the law in different cultural contexts. While zijiren and guanxi are indeed concepts unique to Chinese societies and cannot be applied directly to study groups of non-Chinese people, it is reasonable to assume that interpersonal relationships within a real or imagined group and attitudes toward the law's moral legitimacy inevitably affect people's legal consciousness in other cultural contexts. It is not a matter of whether these two factors shape legal collusion or not, but rather a matter of degree.",

    "abstract": "Judges rarely reveal their real reasoning in their opinions when they are influenced by factors that they know they should not consider. The natural next question is how, when a judge is improperly influenced, he or she reasons to justify a biased decision. In a set of experiments using incumbent Chinese judges, we first replicated the findings of previous studies that showed judges can be influenced by extra-legal factors. More importantly, we showed that judges may employ a range of legal techniques to rationalize decision biases: they interpret legal standards and legal concepts strategically, finesse the applicability of law, infer or deny causation and foreseeability, and draw different conclusions from facts. Our findings provide a more realistic understanding of how judges behave, and cast doubt on reasoned elaboration as a guarantee of judicial transparency and trustworthiness.",
    "conclusion": "Llewellyn (1931) critically argued that rule of law has never really existed because judges have always made law themselves, using rules to make their decisions seem plausible. Reasoned elaboration in the judicial decision-making process has been thought to constrain judicial arbitrariness and safeguard judicial transparency and trustworthiness (Fuller 1978; Hart & Sacks 1994; Waldron 2011). In this article, however, we find that judges can use reasons to incorporate their personal feelings. We provide evidence that they do so using a wide range of legal techniques and in many areas of the law: from interpreting legal standards to deciding applicability of law and from inferring causation to confirming mere facts. Our findings cast doubt on the effectiveness of reasoned elaboration as a means to ensure judicial transparency, and provide a more realistic understanding of how judges behave. How to reduce bias and constrain judicial discretionary power is a direction in which future research may proceed.",

    "abstract": "The new Civil Code of the People's Republic of China (“the Code”), enacted by the National People's Congress (“NPC”), is now the most authoritative statute in private law matters. The Code has three rules for liquidated damages. The first rule gives contracting parties the freedom to agree on this remedy and enjoy its convenience and clarity. It reduces the burden of proof, saves judicial resources, and respects freedom of contract. The second rule lets contracting parties request the courts to increase or reduce pre-set amounts that are disproportionate to the losses caused by breaches. This unique and flexible mechanism balances justice for both contracting sides, guarantees the validity of liquidated damages, advances respect for contractual freedom, makes this remedy more compensatory, and introduces benefits that other jurisdictions lack. However, the third rule is defective, unjustifiably imposing different liabilities on those delaying contract performance compared to other breaches. This Article traces and analyzes the academic and historical roots of this problem, finding that the NPC has caused this defective rule to persist for over twenty years by mingling two contradictory academic assessment criteria and injecting confusion into black-letter laws. This Article proposes a solution through a slight amendment to this rule. Furthermore, this Article identifies a gap in the Code regarding whether liquidated damages and contractual damages can concurrently apply. The NPC created this gap and let it exist for *460 decades, causing nationwide contradictory judicial judgments, despite its significant impact on contracting parties. By examining the nature of two remedies, this Article proposes a reform to fill the gap. This Article has academic value by further advancing the underpinnings of liquidated damages, tackling longstanding confusion, and filling current research gaps. It can also be a practical guide for utilizing this important remedy, both for China and its global trade partners. As the Code took effect recently, this analysis is also timely.",
    "conclusion": "This Article has reviewed and examined the three rules of liquidated damages in the Civil Code. It found subsections 585(1) and 585(2) are well justified, reinforcing the legitimacy of these two rules. In particular, the flexible mechanism established by subsection 585(2) is unique in Chinese law and can introduce benefits that other jurisdictions lack. Notwithstanding this, subsection 585(3) was found to be defective. This Article scrutinized the academic and historical causes of the problem, dissected those causes, and proposed a legal reform to solve the problem. Further, this Article proposed another reform to fill the gap in the Civil Code and end the nationwide contradictory judgments in relation to an important matter about the concurrency of liquidated damages and contractual damages. These two reforms endeavor to eliminate the confusion and gap caused by the NPC for more than twenty years. The ultimate purpose is to *489 refine the rules of liquidated damages and make them more coherent, powerful, and effective. The two recommendations for reform could be submitted to and considered by the NPC when the NPC next decides to amend the Civil Code. Apart from adding extra layers of academic value and filling the current research gaps, this Article can also serve as a practical guide for legal and commercial communities, both inside and outside China, as to how to utilize this important and commonly used remedy in the context of the new Civil Code of China.",

    "abstract": "Theory offers two diverging views on the effects of ex ante litigation risk on corporate liquidity proxied by cash holdings. Ex ante litigation risk, however, is difficult to measure. We test the liquidity effects of ex ante litigation risk by exploiting the phase-by-phase introduction of securities class actions (SCAs) in Korea. Following the increase in litigation risk, firms significantly increase their internal liquidity, especially those without directors' and officers' liability insurance and those that are financially constrained. The results hold robustly in difference-in-differences and regression discontinuity designs. We also find that the increase in ex ante SCA risk improves firms' stock market liquidity and valuation, especially for firms that do not carry liability insurance. Taken together, the results are consistent with the arguments that SCAs increase firms' liability risk and lower investors' risk.",
    "conclusion": "There are two opposing theoretical arguments on the effects of ex ante litigation risk on firms' internal liquidity: the precautionary saving motive, which predicts that firms may hoard more cash in response to higher ex ante litigation risk, and the strategic motive, which posits that firms may strategically reduce cash holdings to reduce the appeal to potential litigants and/or secure an advantageous bargaining position in litigation. Reflecting this theoretically ambiguous link between litigation risk and cash holdings, Crane (2011) and Arena and Julio (2015) report mixed evidence. We investigate the effects of ex ante litigation risk on corporate liquidity by exploiting the passage of a law in 2003 that introduced SCAs in Korea. The law's phase-by-phase implementation results in a clear control group before 2007. Examining 3 years before and after the law was passed, the DID analysis shows that treatment firms hoard more cash as a response to the higher SCA risk. This result is more consistent with the precautionary saving motive than the strategic motive. The increase in liquidity is concentrated in treatment firms that carried no D&O insurance coverage before the law's change and is more pronounced in *137 firms that had more volatile cash flows or were financially constrained before the change in the law. Using matched control firms and an RDD analysis exploiting the variations in firms within the narrow band of the asset threshold prescribed by the law yields similar results. We then extend the analysis from firms' internal liquidity to stock market liquidity and stock valuation. The SCA risk may result in higher stock liquidity and a higher valuation through the ex ante governance effect and the ex post loss-compensation effect, which increases the confidence of uninformed investors in a firm and likely lowers the price discount uninformed investors impose on the firm's stocks. On the other hand, the introduction of SCAs may lower firms' valuation because firms exposed to SCA risk tend to hoard more cash that cannot be used for productive investments or investors anticipate firms' need to pay out cash to some aggrieved parties who are no longer shareholders in the event of an SCA suit. Higher litigation risk may also result in more costly debt financing. Both stock liquidity and firm valuation increase after the introduction of SCAs in firms that are not protected by D&O insurance. The evidence speaks to the net benefits of SCAs and the attenuating effects of D&O insurance. We also test the theoretically ambiguous effects of SCA risk on corporate investment and find that the net effect is statistically insignificant. Overall, we provide novel causal evidence of ex ante shareholder litigation risk on liquidity effects (both internal and external) and relatedly the effects on firm valuation. The study extends the literature that has thoroughly investigated the effects of litigation on the firms being sued or their peers and the mixed results on the effects of ex ante litigation risk on corporate liquidity. It also extends prior studies examining the effects of variation in country-level protection for investors on stock liquidity by providing evidence on the effects of protection for investors within a country. It is worth pointing out that while the phase-in application of the 2003 SCA Act to firms with different asset sizes in Korea enables us to perform a DID analysis and an RDD analysis, a limitation is that the control group is potentially subject to the anticipation effect and therefore not free from the influence of SCAs. A further limitation for the external validity of the analysis is that the treatment sample is composed of a small number of the largest Korean companies. The limitations leave room for further research on the effects of SCAs in other jurisdictions.",

    "abstract": "Rising tensions in the South China Sea are a tired front of great power competition. Since President Barack Obama's “pivot to Asia,” there has been renewed attention on growing Chinese naval power and influence, which stands to challenge the U.S. status as the world's preeminent naval force. Despite a clear and obvious interest in maintaining a favorable global oceans regime, the United States has not ratified the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), the principal international instrument governing the use of the oceans. Instead, the United States argues that ratification is unnecessary because UNCLOS “embodies” customary international law. This Note explores the legal context of U.S. nonmembership and analyzes its implications along three axes: U.S. rights and obligations, access to effective dispute settlement mechanisms, and the ability to shape future developments of the law of the sea. It concludes that relying on customary international law without being party to UNCLOS is not sufficient to guarantee the foundation of the U.S. Freedom of Navigation policy. On the contrary, ratification is in the U.S. best interest: it would lock in a favorable status quo, lend the United States credibility to meaningfully challenge divergent behavior, and offer a venue to shape the future of the law of the sea.",
    "conclusion": "The reach of the modern law of the sea can be dizzying. It exists on a foundation of both customary international law and conventional treaty law. It implicates everything from national security to trade, fishing, energy, the environment, and individual enjoyment of the oceans. And it occupies a rare status in international relations as practically all States recognize the clear benefit and need of legal standardization. If past is prologue, there is little doubt that the global oceans will continue to be a central arena of great power competition--and the SCS will be its main stage. As powers vie for influence in the SCS, as emerging technologies and geopolitical winds shift, and as the law develops to keep pace, tensions will remain. In particular, as competing superpowers, the United States and China, maneuver to entrench their visions of the rules governing the global oceans, their navies, diplomats, and proxies will be placed in uncomfortably close quarters. To repurpose the proverbial sentiment, when great ships play chicken the wake disrupts the sea. A single strategic miscalculation or tactical misstep when navigating these tensions could lead to disastrous consequences. Getting it right is important. The U.S. position on the law of the sea stands on shaky legs. The United States cannot rely on customary law to protect key U.S. FON provisions. Customary law is inherently indeterminate, volatile, and subject to reinterpretation. Ratification bypasses these shortcomings by providing a firm legal foundation with embedded dispute settlement mechanisms, which together offer stability, predictability, and a rule set that is remarkably favorable to U.S. interests. Of course, opponents raise valid concerns. Ratification would subject the United States to international courts, but the benefits of having recourse to a *991 court with the jurisdiction to peacefully settle disputes has been undervalued. Far from being an abdication of congressional responsibility or a degradation of U.S. sovereignty, ratification would amplify the voice of U.S. policymakers to shape the law and to express and protect U.S. interests. Ratification would open the doors to important venues for U.S. leadership, thereby augmenting, not undermining, sovereignty. After all, given that the United States already abides by the treaty provisions, formal accession to the treaty would signal to the world that U.S.-styled FON is and will continue to be the global norm. In sum, global oceans challenges will continue to complicate U.S. interests and security. The law, the world, and the sea are all rapidly changing. The question is, will the United States be positioned to effectively cope? Although at one point ratifying UNCLOS may have threatened U.S. interests, the strategic environment has shifted. Today, it is not ratifying that carries the greater risk.",

    "abstract": "Foreign direct investment in the People's Republic of China (P.R.C. or China) entered a new era when the Foreign Investment Law (FIL) became effective on January 1, 2020.1 In this context, foreign direct investment refers to the establishment of a business entity in China using capital supplied, in whole or in part, by a company based in the United States or another foreign country.2 Since China's open era began in 1979, foreign direct investment in China was governed by a special set of laws, including *3 the Equity Joint Venture Law,3 the Contractual Joint Venture Law,4 the Wholly Foreign Owned Enterprise Law, and related regulations.5 All foreign investment enterprises--i.e., business entities formed by foreign corporations in China--were established under these laws by undergoing an elaborate set of approval procedures. Most foreign companies chose to establish Sino-foreign joint ventures consisting of two or more partners, usually a foreign company that was either U.S.-based or multinational, and a local Chinese company.7 For a U.S. company, a joint venture would be appealing because of the local partner's understanding of Chinese culture and its ability to navigate China's complex laws and politics.8 The local partner was usually a state-owned enterprise--a business entity owned by the state and under the control of the Communist Party.9 Further, most of China's industrial sectors were legally inaccessible to foreign companies in the absence of an established joint venture with a local partner.10 Thus, joint ventures with Chinese partners granted foreign companies the ability to do business in certain highly lucrative industries. As of the first quarter of 2022, there were approximately 124,600 Sino-foreign joint ventures in China. All prior laws governing joint ventures lapsed when the FIL and the Foreign Investment Law Implementing Regulations (FILIR) came into effect on January 1, 2020.12 All previously established joint ventures under the prior legal regime became subject to the FIL, P.R.C. Company Law and *4 related regulations.13 However, these joint ventures received a safe harbor period of five years by the end of which they were required to reorganize and register under the Company Law.14 The deadline marking the end of the five-year grace period is looming in the near future: December 31, 2024.15 The FIL Implementing Regulations indicate that registration is still possible beyond this date but missing the deadline would result in a host of serious legal and regulatory problems.16 For these reasons, all joint ventures organized under the previous legal regime are well-advised to file for corporate reorganization by the statutory deadline. A successful reorganization under the Company Law, however, involves a number of complex issues that could become a trap for the unwary or unsophisticated. This Article explains and analyzes these issues, as well as proposes several approaches to successfully comply with the registration requirements of the FIL in advance of the December 31st deadline.",
    "conclusion": "The fast-approaching deadline to reorganize and register existing joint ventures under the FIL and the Company Law requires U.S. companies in joint ventures to expeditiously organize their legal and regulatory affairs in compliance with the new statutory scheme. Missing the deadline would impose serious legal and regulatory obstacles that threaten the continued operation and viability of joint ventures established under the prior legal regime. While complying with registration requirements is not difficult, careful planning is required to avoid the pitfalls and traps that await the unwary. U.S. and other foreign companies doing business in China must comply with registration requirements in a timely manner to take advantage of the more favorable investment climate in China created by the historic FIL.",

    "doi": "",
    "abstract": "This article presents the findings of original research on “judge quota” reform. The reform's agenda was essentially aimed at professionalization: by edging out a given percentage of judges, only the better qualified judges would be re-appointed to create a more professionalized judiciary. A key component of the reform was to reduce the level and the intensity of both political and bureaucratic control over judges in adjudication and to decentralize judicial power to the rank-and-file judges, restoring individualized judging while enhancing judicial accountability. This article critically examines the potential and limits of the judge quota reform in the context of incremental legal reform in a party-state.",
    "conclusion": "For academic observers, the macro political context matters more than technical details; for the first generation of reformers on the ground, however, there is no other viable alternative to the incremental reform that has defined their careers. They made full use of the reform opportunities that the party-state offered to create a limited judicial space while realizing and accepting the political and institutional constraints. As the quota reform story testifies, the judiciary within an authoritarian political system can explore spaces for its own professionalization - judges can judge on their own most of the time and in most of the cases. In that process, the Party could be both a helping and a restraining hand, and the bureaucratic system, of which the court is an integral part, creates both positive and negative incentives for the reform. As soon as the reform project launched, it was subjected to processes of negotiation, compromise and adjustment. In any event, managing suspicious Party leaders concerned about the political implications of a potentially run-away court and an angry public resentful of judicial corruption and incompetency is only part of the difficulties. Pushing reform through the bureaucratic maze against the vested interests of multiple stakeholders has always been a litmus test of the wisdom of reformist leaders in China's political-legal system.",

    "abstract": "This article provides an empirical evaluation of the effectiveness of the judicial reform measures implemented in China in the 2010s. Among other objectives, the reforms aimed to strengthen the independence of judges, the financial autonomy of courts and the professionalism of adjudicators. Critics have questioned the success of the reforms, citing continued government intervention with adjudication and unchanged structural problems with courts. To date, there has been limited empirical literature focusing specifically on the judicial reform measures in the 2010s in China. This article provides a glimpse into what really was happening on the ground since the reforms through the lens of frontline judges. It concludes that the reforms have enhanced the financial autonomy of courts, the independence of individual adjudicators and the quality of judgments. 47% of the judges who responded to the survey agreed that the judicial reform was extremely effective. However, this study also reveals that the reforms failed to tackle deep-seated problems of the Chinese judiciary. Local government intervention with adjudication is still rampant. Courts continued to be severely understaffed. Judges are still ready to abridge procedures to arrive at an outcome that is consistent with the policy of the court leadership. While *88 the reform is not “old wine in a new bottle”, there is still much room for improvement in the administration of justice in China.",
    "conclusion": "Considering China's socio-political constraints and the judiciary's focus on substantive social justice, this article answers whether China's courts have effectively achieved the objectives of the Judicial Reform in the 2010s. The overall objective of the Judicial Reform in the 2010s is the public feels that justice is done in every single court case. This can be translated into seven sub-objectives: (1) courts are more able to adjudicate cases independently than before; (2) the courts have more financial autonomy than before; (3) individual judges are able to adjudicate cases more independently than before; (4) implement the life responsibility system for the judges; (5) implement the judges quota system for the judges; (6) change the quantitative assessment of the judges; and (7) improve the quality of written judgments. Through an in-depth empirical analysis, this article finds that, overall, the Judicial Reform in the 2010s has been effective in China, but there are some critical limitations. First, despite the impetus of judicial reform, the basic nature of government interference in the courts remains unchanged. The government still maintains considerable power in some sensitive cases *126 and continues to influence the outcome of court cases. This phenomenon suggests that the reform is still, to some extent, influenced by political constraints. Second, the fiscal autonomy of the courts has increased slightly under the judicial reform, but its actual impact has been relatively limited. Fiscal reforms aim to centralise fiscal power at the provincial court level to increase the autonomy of the local courts. However, local governments still maintain their influence by controlling the administrative resources of the courts, resulting in limited local autonomy of the courts. Third, judicial reform enables individual judges to be more independent in adjudicating cases. The introduction of the judges quota system raises the threshold for becoming a judge and simplifies the administrative tasks of judges, contributing to improving the professionalism of judges and reducing unnecessary internal administrative distractions. In addition, the life responsibility of judges requires judges to improve their judicial skills, as they are held personally accountable for their decisions. Fourth, despite some of the benefits of the quota system, the problem of the exodus of judges is progressively worsening due to the life responsibility system and the absence of a matching system of benefits and promotions for judges. Finally, the quality of written judgments has improved because of the judicial reform. The judicial reform encourages judges to pay more attention to the content and quality of written judgments to enhance the judicial transparency and justice. Overall, while positive results have been achieved, the judicial reform still faces many challenges, including government interference and the loss of judges. Judicial reform in China faces a major obstacle in that judicial culture favours substantive social justice over procedural justice. The roots of this problem are deeply imbued in China's history, culture, and legal traditions, and, therefore, cannot be solved simply through piecemeal reforms. Traditional Chinese legal concepts attach a high degree of importance to the social effects of a case. This emphasis on substantive social justice leads to judicial decisions aim to maintain social stability at the expense of procedural justice. Meanwhile, China's judiciary system is chronically subject to interference from governmental authorities which also undermine procedural justice. To target this problem, future judicial reforms require the joint participation and support of the government and society.",

    "abstract": "Increasingly, algorithms challenge legal regulations, and also challenge the right to explanation, personal privacy and freedom, and individual equal protection. As decision-making mechanisms for human-machine interaction, algorithms are not value-neutral and should be legally regulated. Algorithm disclosure, personal data empowerment, and anti-algorithmic discrimination are traditional regulatory methods relating to algorithms, but mechanically using these methods presents difficulties in feasibility and desirability. Algorithm disclosure faces difficulties such as technical infeasibility, meaningless disclosure, user gaming and intellectual property right infringement. And personal data empowerment faces difficulties such as personal difficulty in exercising data rights and excessive personal data empowerment, making it difficult for big data and algorithms to operate effectively. Anti-algorithmic discrimination faces difficulties such as non-machine algorithmic discrimination, impossible status neutrality, and difficult realization of social equality. Taking scenarios of algorithms lightly is the root cause of the traditional algorithm regulation path dilemma. Algorithms may differ in attributes due to specific algorithmic subjects, objects and domains involved. Therefore, algorithm regulation should be developed and employed based on a case-by-case approach to the development of accountable algorithms. Following these development principles, specific rules can be enacted to regulate algorithm disclosure, data empowerment, and anti-algorithmic discrimination.",

    "abstract": "In 2020, with the onset of the Covid-19 Pandemic, China embarked on one of the largest expansions of administrative capacity in its modern history. Compared to its pre-Covid self, the current Chinese Party-state apparatus can now track and govern individual activity with unprecedented precision and regularity. While some of these developments were emergency measures that were limited to the pandemic, many of them have become institutionally entrenched through generalized lawmaking and policymaking, permanently transforming the Chinese government’s relationship with its population. Most importantly, the Party-state delegated enormous administrative law enforcement and information collection powers to two levels of urban government - the “subdistrict,” and below it, the “neighborhood community” - that used to be institutionally marginalized. This Article is the first systemic study of this paradigmatic transformation. Through a comprehensive analysis of central-level laws, regulations, and policies, paired with local case studies from major cities, it traces the institutional framework and political logic of Chinese administrative expansion. Its core argument is that the sudden onset of Covid-19 forced cohesive action onto a previously internally conflicted political landscape. Chinese leaders had contemplated a significant expansion of urban local governance as early as 2012, when Xi Jinping first rose to power, but as recently as 2018-19, they still seemed torn about its potential to aggravate principal-agent problems within the Party-state. The arrival of the pandemic rapidly and definitively resolved this internal debate in favor of expansionism, producing the extraordinary informational and law enforcement apparatus that now exists in close proximity to every urban resident.",
    "conclusion": "In most countries, the onset of the Covid-19 Pandemic led to some form of administrative expansion, if only to enforce the lockdowns that were commonplace globally in 2020 and even 2021. Many, perhaps most, of these countries pursued administrative expansion under the legal framework of emergency powers, which gave governments a temporary boost in control capacity, but also sent a clear signal that there would be, at some point, a reversion back to the institutional status quo. By 2022 or early 2023, administrative powers had indeed reverted back to its pre-pandemic status quo in most Western countries-with mask mandates removed and declarations of emergency formally terminated. Even in countries like Japan, South Korea, or Singapore, where Covid control measures were significantly stricter than in Europe or North America, policies were unmistakably loosening by 2022, with few signs, if any, of a permanent expansion in administrative power. From that perspective, the Chinese experience studied in this article is highly unusual: not only were Chinese pandemic controls significantly tighter than in almost any other country, but they produced a large and permanent, rather than merely “emergency,” increase in the state’s administrative capacity. The Chinese government certainly made use of emergency laws to justify many of its initial actions, but those actions pale in long-term significance compared to the systemic “descension” of coercive authority to the lowest tiers of urban governance. It is perhaps tempting to simply attribute this to the Chinese Party-state’s authoritarian character, but that would overlook the obvious fact that few other authoritarian regimes, if any, appear to have experienced a comparable phase of permanent administrative expansion during the pandemic: not Singapore, not Turkey, not Russia, not Vietnam. In fact, without the institutional groundwork that had already been laid between 2012 and 2019, it is rather doubtful that the pandemic could have produced such a permanent administrative expansion even in China. It is worth noting that previous large-scale Chinese governmental responses to infectious diseases-for example, the SARS outbreak of 2003-produced nothing of the sort. Covid-19 hit China precisely at a major institutional juncture where the Party leadership was thinking seriously about administrative expansion, but had yet to fully commit to it. That made all the difference. The pandemic gave policymakers and lawmakers the final, decisive shove they needed to take the plunge, and the country will be living with its enormous institutional consequences far after the pandemic itself has become but a distant memory. For better or worse, China has now entered a new administrative paradigm.",

    "abstract": "As tensions continue to grow across the Taiwan Strait, China is using domestic maritime law to justify an expansion of police power in the international waters of the Taiwan Strait in violation of international law. This Comment will argue that the People's Republic of China has violated the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (“UNCLOS”) by implementing non-resource-related police power in waters meant only for resource exploration and management. In comparing the language of China's domestic maritime law with that of UNCLOS, this Comment will show that the People's Republic of China has used domestic law to reinterpret and obfuscate its obligations under UNCLOS. As a result, the freedom of navigation granted by UNCLOS to all States has been restricted by China's policing. To prevent China from using its domestic law to assert increasing control over the Strait, the Tribunal of the Law of the Sea should issue an advisory opinion clarifying the purpose of Exclusive Economic Zones and denouncing China's noncompliance with UNCLOS. Additionally, foreign States should continue to exercise freedom of navigation through the Taiwan Strait and push China to limit its police activity of the Strait.",
    "conclusion": "Since its enactment, UNCLOS has held the freedom-of-the-seas doctrine as a key tenant in the rights of all States. In pursuit of preserving this doctrine, UNCLOS provides for high seas freedoms of navigation and overflight through the EEZ and limits coastal State jurisdiction in the EEZ. Under Article 58 of UNCLOS, every State has the right to exercise high seas freedoms through another State’s EEZ and on the high seas. In the past, China has tried to extend its sovereignty beyond its territorial sea. It has also tried to claim an EEZ around natural features that do not qualify under UNCLOS. In addressing these issues, an arbitral tribunal ruled that China could not lay claims to the SCS beyond what was established by UNCLOS. Similarly, China cannot lay claims to the EEZ corridor of the Taiwan Strait beyond what is provided by UNCLOS and cannot engage in activities or assert jurisdiction in the Taiwan Strait in ways that practically prevent foreign ships from exercising high seas freedoms. By using its MPL and revised MTSL to expand its jurisdiction and engage in police surveillance over foreign ships, China has violated UNCLOS. First, China has effectively restricted foreign vessels’ practice of free navigation by (1) requiring those vessels to notify Chinese authorities of entry into whatever waters China deems it has control over, and (2) by authorizing the CCG to physically inhibit vessels from transiting its EEZ by stopping the vessel, boarding it for inspection, and possibly requiring it to leave “Chinese waters” when the CCG sees fit. This directly contradicts high seas freedoms of navigation as provided for in articles 58, 86, and 87 of UNCLOS.",

    "abstract": "Many governments have engaged in policy experimentation in various forms to resolve uncertainty and facilitate learning. However, little is understood about the characteristics of policy experimentation, and how the structure of experimentation may affect policy learning and policy outcomes. We aim to describe and understand China’s policy experimentation since 1980, among the largest and most systematic in recent history. We collect comprehensive data on policy experimentation conducted in China over the past four decades. We find three main results. First, more than 80% of the experiments exhibit positive sample selection in terms of a locality’s economic development, and much of this can be attributed to misaligned incentives across political hierarchies. Second, local politicians allocate more resources to ensure the experiments’ success, and such effort is not replicable when policies roll out to the entire country. Third, the presence of sample selection and strategic effort is not fully accounted for by the central government, thus affecting policy learning and distorting national policies originating from the experimentation. Taken together, these results suggest that while China’s bureaucratic and institutional conditions make policy experimentation at such scale possible, the complex political environments can also limit the scope and bias the direction of policy learning.",
    "conclusion": "In this project, we systematically examine China’s policy experimentation over the past four decades, one of the largest undertakings of systematic policy learning in recent history. We present three sets of results. First, policy experimentation sites are substantially positively selected, and misaligned incentives across political hierarchies account for much of the observed positive selection. Second, experimental situation during policy experimentation is unrepresentative: local politicians exert strategic efforts and allocate more resources during experimentation that may exaggerate policy effectiveness. Third, the positive sample selection and unrepresentative experimental situation are not fully accounted for when the central government evaluates experimentation outcomes, which would bias policy learning and national policies originated from the experiments. We highlight that policy learning and policy experimentation inevitably take place in complex environments with various constraints and distortions. The political and bureaucratic environment could affect the initiation of policy experimentation, its structure and implementation, and the bias in the information one may gather from an experiment. Our findings stand in contrast with theoretical work analyzing experimentation in federalist environments featuring voluntary local initiatives (Mukand and Rodrik 2005; Callander and Harstad 2015; Myerson 2015). While misaligned incentives between the central and local governments generate sub-optimal learning, rather than the informational free-riding and under-experimentation observed in federalist systems, political centralization in a context such as China, where local governments compete and differentiate in order to increase their chances of promotion, could induce over-experimentation. Our examination of China’s policy experiments suggests that, while experimentation can facilitate reform and prevent policy disasters, one needs to pay attention to the manner in which policy experiments are conducted, as more information does not necessarily result in better decision making. Our findings that policies originating from unrepresentative experimentation could disproportionately benefit richer regions demonstrate yet another manifestation of regulatory capture - by systematically biasing the information that decision makers gather during the policy learning process - in addition to pure regulatory capture (e.g., Stigler 1971), capture through corruption (e.g., Shleifer 1996), and capture through enforcement (e.g., Glaeser and Shleifer 2003), recent literature has documented more subtle forms of cognitive capture of regulators (e.g., Johnson and Kwak 2011) and capture through philanthropic giving and strategic advocacy (Bertrand et al. 2020).19 Moreover, our findings point to a fundamental trade-off that the central government faces: structuring political incentives in order to stimulate politicians’ effort to improve policy outcomes, while making sure that such incentives are not exaggerated during the experimentation phase, so that policy learning remains unbiased. Future work on mechanism design solutions that could improve the efficiency of policy learning could be of great policy relevance and importance.",

While the regime mandates rigid sentencing, judges, acting under political pressures from both above and below, covertly impose biased penalties on petitioners accused of creating a disturbance. For defendants who petitioned Beijing or petitioned during a sensitive period, judges are subject to pressure from above and accordingly impose longer sentences and restrict the use of probation. For petitioners who seek support from mass allies, judges reduce the defendant’s sentence and grant probation, as pressure from below helps judges to partly resist administrative interferences.

    "abstract": "How do state authorities cope with popular contention under authoritarian legality? Based on ethnographic fieldwork and legal repression cases in China, this article highlights that conflicting rules and signals regarding contention management can impose considerable pressure on governments and motivate them to respond cautiously, even though the prevailing rhetoric of law-based governance provides a convenient basis on which authorities can legitimize their coercive actions. This study further theorizes a discreet pattern of government reaction under authoritarian legality - progressive legal repression - that rests on bureaucratic processing to overcome political uncertainty and lower potential risks before formally employing criminal sanctions to achieve domination. Instead of directly using criminal penalties to deter unruly protesters and potential dissenters, the preferred state action is to induce them to engage in available legal-bureaucratic procedures. By reconceptualizing protesters’ claims and behaviour as unreasonable and signalling fulfilment of responsibilities, bureaucratic practices help officials to reduce the risks of damaging their political image and receiving disciplinary action, encouraging them to deploy legal repression. This study reveals more complicated dynamics of state repression under authoritarian legality and emphasizes the important effects of procedural practices on governmental responses and the regime's stability.",
    "conclusion": "Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork in Guangdong, legal repression cases and government documents, this article examines how local governments cope with popular contention under the legal governance campaign in Xi Jinping's China. This study reveals a novel dynamic of state repression under authoritarian legality, namely, progressive legal repression. Instead of promptly issuing criminal proceedings to defuse threatening popular contention, the preferred state action is to induce aggrieved citizens to engage in available legal-bureaucratic procedures and then rely on bureaucratic practices to overcome political uncertainty and reduce the potential risks before officially resorting to criminal prosecution. This study further explores the conditions under which such progressive legal repression emerges and the mechanisms through which bureaucratic processing helps state agents to reduce risk.",

      "authorsDataDescription": "To explore how local governments deal with unruly protesters under the legal government campaign, I spent three months in 2014 conducting ethnographic fieldwork in W City, Guangdong. The fieldwork was conducted right after the official launch of the campaign in November 2013, which, as I discuss below, proved to be a crucial turning point as the rhetoric of legal governance promptly spread throughout the propaganda system from 2014 to 2015. I gained access to a county-level bureau for letters and visits (xinfangju 信访局, BLV hereafter) in W City through personal connections. I chose a county-level BLV to conduct fieldwork because it is where protest issues are commonly contested and resolved, whereas higher-level BLVs mainly return petition cases to county-level BLVs after receiving complaints. During the fieldwork, I was allowed to observe officials as they received complainants and handled petition cases. I observed approximately 60 cases of contention. The time-limited observation did not allow me to observe the entire trajectory of the government response in these cases, as the resolution of protest cases following bureaucratic procedures can often take years and sometimes even more than a decade. However, the different levels of bureaucratic processing in these cases gave me the opportunity to gain insights into how local officials understand the role of bureaucratic processing in protest control and how they manage contentious activities before and after some bureaucratic practices. I conducted unstructured, informal interviews with six officials working in the BLV and typically asked them to provide more details after the observations. To examine whether local agents behave differently in more legally developed regions, I also conducted semi-structured interviews with five local officials working in district and subdistrict governments in Guangzhou between 2014 and 2015.",

    "abstract": "The arena of the law of the sea has become a battlefield for Sino-American legal warfare, commonly referred to as “lawfare,” and it is in the tumultuous waters of the South China Sea where this fierce contest of great powers rages. The divergent perspectives on international law, particularly regarding maritime law, between China and the United States stem from the countries' distinct historical experiences, memories, and outlooks. This inherent disparity in epistemology shapes their comprehension of the fundamental tenets of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (“UNCLOS”), specifically the conflicting notions of mare clausum and mare liberum. Consequently, the universality of the law of the sea becomes compromised, tending towards a less comprehensive international framework. This article contends that any legal resolution to the South China Sea dispute must be scrutinized through the lens of balance-of-power considerations. It further proposes practical recommendations to enhance the clarity and efficacy of some of the UNCLOS institutions in response to the pressing demands of our time.",
    "conclusion": "Undoubtedly, U.S. and Chinese international lawyers perceive the role of the law of the sea from distinct vantage points shaped by their geographical and cultural identities. The indeterminacy of the core UNCLOS provisions compounds such disparities in perception. In essence, while the international law of the sea is intended to be universally applicable, its interpretation and application vary among international lawyers.443 UNCLOS falls far short of addressing contemporary maritime issues arising from a changing global landscape, including the challenges posed by climate change and the emergence of innovative technologies.444 As has been seen, the intricacies of territorial and maritime disputes in the South China Sea are intricately intertwined with the shifting power dynamics between China and the United States. It becomes increasingly challenging to anticipate a legal solution that can defuse this protracted legal conflict. Suppose China, the United States, and the international community fail to take prompt and necessary actions. In that case, the principles of the rule of law at sea and the legitimacy of the UNCLOS regime will suffer significant setbacks. Furthermore, the potential establishment of separate Chinese and U.S. interpretations of UNCLOS would undermine the current maritime system’s effectiveness and legitimacy. To address the substantial divergence in interpretations and applications of UNCLOS between China and the United States, this article proposes utilizing the existing mechanisms within the UNCLOS framework and/or formulating bilateral U.S.-China joint declarations. It is imperative for legal scholars from both nations, among others, to contemplate measures aimed at resolving this longstanding interpretive legal dispute, drawing upon the suggestions presented in this article. For better or worse, considerations of power dynamics must be incorporated into the legal discourse. Every challenge presents an opportunity. With the aid of an interdisciplinary approach to international law and international relations, the South China Sea dispute can be steered toward a peacefully managed trajectory.",

Beginning in 1958, the Chinese central government assigned different targets for grain yields in most counties, based on their geographic location. All targets seemed unrealistically high. Using novel county-level data, combined with a spatial regression discontinuity strategy, we find evidence that these radical grain targets prompted excessive procurement and subsequent famine. Our estimates show that a one-standard deviation increase in grain yield targets led to an 18‰ higher death rate in 1960. This article sheds new light on the consequences of target-setting in an authoritarian regime without considering local contexts. (JEL O21, N45, P26).",

This article contributes to this large literature by providing a missing link between the radical targets for grain yields implemented in the Great Leap Forward and the famine. In 1957, the Chinese central government adopted a national agricultural policy that set radical grain yield targets for most Chinese counties according to their geographic location. Using novel county-level data, combined with a SRD strategy, we find evidence that these radical targets caused excessive grain procurement and subsequent famine. Our estimates show that a one-standard-deviation increase in grain yield targets led to an 18‰ higher death rate in 1960. Our study highlights the severe consequences of target-setting without considering local context, especially in an authoritarian regime characterized by a lack of accountability and monitoring of local officials.",

    "conclusion": "Chinese local officials frequently turn to relational repression to demobilize protesters. When popular action occurs, they investigate activists' social ties, locate individuals who might be willing to help stop the protest, assemble a work team, and dispatch it to conduct thought work. Work team members are then expected to use their personal influence to persuade relatives, friends and fellow townspeople to stand down. Thought workers with weak ties to protesters are encouraged to work with extra intensity and to rely on people they know with closer connections. Those who fail to “transform” the protesters they are assigned are often subject to punishment, including suspension of salary, removal from office and prosecution. Relational repression sometimes works. When the authorities have considerable say over work team members and bonds with protesters are strong, relational repression can help put an end to popular action. Even if thought work does not halt a protest entirely, it can limit its length and scope by reducing tension at times of high strain and providing a channel for negotiation and discussion of possible compromises. Quite often, however, insufficiently tight ties and limited concern with consequences creates a commitment deficit, partly because thought workers recognize their scant effectiveness with many protesters and partly because they anticipate little punishment for failing to demobilize anyone other than a close relative. During the Huashui protests, thought workers with few ties were ignored and better-connected ones experienced pushback. Many sided with protesters against the polluters and feared being denounced, ostracized, or called traitors. Most thought workers did not throw themselves into their work and a handful refused to do it at all. Despite the rapport some team members had with the tent-sitters, relational repression in Huashui failed and the authorities closed the chemical park to bring an end to the encampment. Relational repression is not a state policy but a local practice that has become more prominent in an era when maintaining stability is paramount and local leaders are highly motivated to prevent or halt protest. For at least one type of dispute - forced eviction - the State Council has gone as far as to issue an urgent circular banning “demolition by implicating homeowners' relatives” (zhulian chaiqian 株连拆迁).Footnote63 Yet relational repression continues and remains common in rural areas (where dense social ties facilitate it) and cities (where many residents still work in units and there is a ready supply of work team members). People who take part in group protests are not the only victims of relational repression. Individual activists also experience it.Footnote64 Lone petitioners, birth control resisters, human rights campaigners and rights protection lawyers all are subject to relational repression.Footnote65 Among collective protesters, urbanites who live in neighbourhoods slated for demolition and villagers whose land has been requisitioned have been targeted especially often in recent years,Footnote66 and even migrant workers have been singled out, despite difficulties in locating intermediaries to place pressure on them.Footnote67 Elderly protesters appear to be particularly common victims of relational repression, perhaps because it is unseemly to use force on them and it is assumed they will be responsive to importuning by younger relatives.Footnote68 As a form of social control, relational repression harks back to the baojia 保甲 system of mutual responsibility in imperial China. The practice of “guilt by association” reminds us that local authorities have long held the population in check by making relatives, friends, and neighbours responsible for each other. The thought work at the heart of relational repression also resonates with governance practices from China's past. Assembling work teams and descending on villages was a standard policy implementation tool in the Maoist era that has received little attention recently.Footnote69 But grassroots thought work and the sudden appearance of big work teams persists, as leaders still seek to “engineer emotions” by mixing “practical incentives and psychological pressures” and tapping a “Confucian stress upon social bonds and obligations.”Footnote70 The era of large-scale mass movements may be over, but “managed campaigns” continue in realms as varied as population control, crisis management and economic development.Footnote71 As campaigns have evolved, so too has ground-level thought work. If work teams were once used to overcome inertia, circumvent opposition and mobilize participation, in today's “harmonious society” (hexie shehui 和谐社会) they are equally often employed to maintain social order and demobilize those who threaten it. That work teams are used to demobilize protesters also speaks to a large literature on networks and popular action. Many studies have shown that protest recruitment “flows along lines of pre-existing social relationships”Footnote72 as social ties enhance feelings of trust and offer newcomers reassurance,Footnote73 while also providing opportunities to apply subtle forms of pressure (“If you go, I'll go, too”).Footnote74 Relational repression in China, on the other hand, illustrates how family, friendship and native-place ties are not just “pull factors”Footnote75 that draw individuals to popular action; they can also be deployed to push people away from contention. When mobilizing protest, strong, weak and even absent ties can all be exploited;Footnote76 for relational repression, tie strength is key. Do strong ties of thought workers to family and friends trump ties to the local state? If they do, commitment deficits and pushback are likely. Finally, attention to relational repression fills in one more piece in the puzzle of protest control. Most accounts of policing focus on the police. This is especially true in China, where the authorities are not hesitant to rely on force to put down popular action. But just as local toughs may be used to carry out hard repression, relatives, friends and fellow townspeople can be agents of soft repression. Societally-based control has advantages that state coercion lacks; most notably, it suppresses contention in a less visible way that does not reflect directly back on the state. By filtering pressure through people the state has influence over, and then expecting them to be the familiar, friendly face that persuades a protester to give up an “inadvisable” course of action, social power is combined with state power. Putting the onus of “soft violence” (ruan baoli 软暴力)Footnote77 on individuals whom protesters are related to, know, or at least share a hometown with, blurs the origins of repression, shields the state from owning up to its authoritarian impulses, and - when it succeeds - diminishes the need to rely on naked coercion. Many questions remain about relational repression. To what extent is it employed before as well as after protest breaks out?Footnote78 Is it seen to be a strong or weak tool, an effective means to halt contention or a likely-to-fail last resort? What tactics do the best thought workers use and what sort of arguments do they marshal? Is relational repression more effective for certain kinds of protest or perhaps in rural areas where communities are tighter, social ties are a bigger part of daily life, and close relatives can be more readily located? Much also remains to be learned about the inner life of thought workers. What does thought work feel like for people who conduct it, some of whom may consider it a tolerable duty, and others of whom undoubtedly would rather avoid it entirely? Do thought workers feel patriotic or guilty when doing their work? Are they typically angry with wayward relatives, friends and neighbours or concerned about them? Relational repression is one of a suite of methods Chinese authorities employ to suppress contention. More research on soft repression, and how officials view and prioritize its many techniques, promises a fuller picture of how a state may respond to protest without resorting to the surest sign of governance failure: outright force.",

    "abstract": "There has been a long-held view since the Federalist Papers that the lower the level of government, the greater is the extent of capture by vested interests. Relying on the analytical framework of relative capture, I challenge this assumption by arguing that interest groups have different incentives and capacities to capture different levels of government. I test the theory by investigating how judges at different judicial levels adjudicate corporate lawsuits in China. Exploiting a quasi-experiment in which the Supreme People’s Court dramatically raised the threshold for entering higher level courts in 2008, I show that privately owned enterprises are more likely to win in lower level courts, and state-owned enterprises are more likely to win in higher level courts. I then employ qualitative interviews to explore the mechanisms behind them. The findings challenge an underlying assumption in the decentralization literature and have important policy implications for countries that are trapped in centralization/decentralization cycles.",
    "conclusion": "As Rodden (2006, pp. 1-2) remarks, “decentralization and the spread of federalism are perhaps the most important trends in governance around the world over the last 50 years.” By the end of the 20th century, estimates of the number of decentralization reforms ranged from 80% of the world’s countries to effectively all of them (Manor, 1999). Since then, further reforms have been announced in several dozen countries as diverse as Bolivia, Cambodia, Ethiopia, France, Indonesia, Japan, Peru, South Africa, South Korea, Uganda, and the United Kingdom (Faguet, 2014). A large literature, however, argues that lower level governments are more susceptible to elite capture. If this presumption is correct, the advantages of decentralization-to bring governments “closer to the people,” induce competition among local governments, and make it easier for citizens to hold their representatives accountable-would be compromised by local elite capture.34 Many countries, including Vietnam and China, that have experienced the disadvantages of decentralization have begun to recentralize to distance politics from special interests. Both decentralization and recentralization reforms have received financial support from international donors, such as the World Bank, the United Nations Development Program, the European Union, the U.S. Agency for International Development, and the Ford Foundation.35 Despite the enthusiasm and generosity on both sides, prior work has offered contradictory conclusions. While some report that decentralization is associated with lower levels of corruption (Fisman & Gatti, 2002), some find that decentralization facilitates elite capture and creates more opportunities for corruption (Mattingly, 2016; Treisman, 2000). Many developing countries lack a straightforward formula and have thus become trapped in what Baum terms “tightening/loosening cycles:” centralizing, decentralizing, and then going back to square one (Baum, 1996). My study helps reconcile this controversy. I argue that the framework of relative capture is useful in examining politicians’ and interest groups’ incentives at different levels of government. The key insight is that a political hierarchy can be relatively captured by different interest groups at different levels. I then use a novel data set of real court cases disclosed by Chinese publicly traded firms to show that cases brought by different firms win at different rates at different court levels. The Chinese tax structure shapes judges’ preferences: Courts favor firms that pay taxes to the territorial party-state. Exploiting a quasi-experiment in which the Supreme Court dramatically raised the monetary threshold for cases to enter higher level courts, which created exogenous variation in cases’ exposure to various levels of courts, I estimate the treatment effect of judicial level on judicial outcomes. I demonstrate that while SOEs are more likely to win in intermediate courts, non-SOEs are more likely to win in basic courts. I employ qualitative interviews to substantiate my proposed mechanisms. My findings generate a policy implication. Politicians and policy makers who want to reduce capture in their countries should carefully examine the relative strength of major interest groups vis-à-vis different levels of government. In countries where the level of economic development is low and most interest groups are small and local, centralization is often effective in reducing local corruption and improving governance. Indeed, Gennaioli and Rainer (2007) find that African countries that are more centralized have a better record of public goods provision, such as education, health, and infrastructure. Conversely, in countries where the economy is more developed and diverse with firms of different sizes, a balance between local autonomy and central control is crucial to avoid capture. For example, many scholars, when comparing the reform experiences of China and Russia, argue that China’s transition has been more successful because the Chinese Communist Party has been in a strong position to control its local agents while maintaining local autonomy, while in Russia, old and inefficient firms benefit from preferential treatment by regional politicians whose power is not constrained by central authorities (Blanchard & Shleifer, 2001; Sonin, 2010). In these more diverse economies, emphasizing decentralization without central control often leads to “local protectionism,” while too much centralization creates “central protectionism.” An important question for many developing countries that are facing this conundrum is to ask “captured by whom?” and design solutions to fit local conditions.",

    "abstract": "How do authoritarian states implement policies that curb individual freedom? In this article, I examine the implementation of the One Child Policy in China, which has had an enormous impact on Chinese society and yet has received little attention from political scientists. I argue that the success or failure of the policy hinged on using frontline bureaucrats to infiltrate society. Important theories suggest that bureaucratic penetration may increase bureaucrats' responsiveness to citizens and decrease implementation of the law. Drawing on a unique dataset and natural experiment, I show the opposite to be true in China: a one standard deviation increase in bureaucratic penetration lowers over-quota births by 2 to 7 percentage points. There is suggestive evidence that bureaucrats leverage their social embeddedness to control society. The article shows how frontline bureaucrats beyond the police, military, or ruling party are key agents of repression and political control.",
    "conclusion": "A trope in some novels and movies about life under autocracy is that when bureaucrats become familiar with the people they govern, it makes them more sympathetic and more willing to defy the state to protect them. In the movie The Lives of Others, for example, a Stasi agent conducts intense surveillance of a suspected dissident writer in East Germany, and the time he spends spying on the writer and learning about his life gradually turns him into a secret ally of the dissident. In the conclusion of the movie, he risks his career and freedom to help the dissident escape the clutches of the Stasi. Social science theories about social embeddedness provide some support for the implication of this portrait of bureaucratic politics. Being more deeply embedded in local society might induce bureaucrats to be more responsive to the people they serve. In contrast, this article suggests that increased state penetration can strengthen the ability of authoritarian states to control society, in part because greater familiarity can make frontline bureaucrats more effective agents of the state. In the long run, however, this strategy likely may have its limits. In the appendix, I present results indicating that greater state penetration is correlated with lower levels of satisfaction with the government (see Table A3). What are the scope conditions of these findings? The implementation of the One Child Policy is a symbol of state capacity in China, which is often held up as an especially important example of a high capacity authoritarian state.63 The general pattern of using frontline bureaucrats to monitor and control behavior is used in other political arenas in China, and in other authoritarian regimes, especially for policies in which there is a mismatch between local preferences and state mandates. These might include family planning policy implementation in other states, such as India, Iran, or Indonesia. Recent scholarship has shown how the Chinese state uses street-level bureaucrats who are embedded in local social networks to expropriate land, repress protest, and monitor civil society groups.64 However, the findings are unlikely to travel to policy areas where there is a potential for local officials to capture rents if they refrain from implementing policies. Work by Mertha on intellectual property rights enforcement in China provides an important example, where penetration by the Administration for Industry and Commerce to local levels increases its power and authority, but also provides an opportunity for bureaucrats to seek rents and look the other way when they observe violations of the law in order to protect a source of government revenue.65 More work needs to be done to understand the role of gender in enforcement of the One Child Policy and, more generally, politics in China and other authoritarian regimes. Koss finds suggestive evidence that female cadres may undermine enforcement of the One Child Policy, a finding that requires further elaboration and exploration. The findings also suggest a need to continue to study street-level bureaucrats in authoritarian regimes. In China, recent work has shown how the CCP is highly responsive to citizen requests; however, it remains less clear when this responsiveness translates to changed policy enforcement, especially at the grassroots level, where decisions are made with important implications for the everyday lives of citizens. The teachers, case officers, lower-level bureaucrats, and ward leaders who interact with the citizens of authoritarian regimes every day play an important role in authoritarian monitoring and feedback, but one which recent studies have only begun to explore.",

    "abstract": "Both the Blackstone ratio and due process are cornerstones of classical philosophy in criminal law and justice around the world. However, less consideration has been paid to contemporary society and whether the public shares this theoretical approach. Using data from four waves of the International Social Survey Programme, examining public attitudes towards controlling habitual criminals and suspected terrorists across countries, I offer evidence for how preference towards authorities’ reactions (a proxy of fear of crime) affects preferences about judicial errors. My analysis shows that (i) the public supports the authorities in taking action against criminals and terrorists without a court order, though in different proportions depending on the specific means at hand; (ii) the apparent paradox of public support for the elegance of due process and fear of crime can be explained by the difficult reality of controlling criminals; (iii) absolute proponents consider type one errors to be worse and thus will not support any measures being taken, while absolute proponents consider type two errors to be worse and steps therefore need to be taken to prevent communities from the risk from crime or terrorist attacks; (iv) members of the public who favour proactive policing are significantly less likely to consider type one errors to be worse than type two; and (v) citizens across countries share the above features in a longitudinal survey. Legislators, law professors, and criminologists in transitional risk societies around the world should reconsider their justification of anti-Blackstonian theory and the crime control model.",
    "conclusion": "Errors are part of human nature; as Justice Antonin Scalia put it, ‘like other human institutions, courts and juries are not perfect’.162 This article is not about how to avoid errors, but rather about how to balance the detriment of judicial mistakes. In this manuscript, I suggest we return to the crime control model and make the following contributions. First, I have aimed to explain the detriment to innocent people of overstating the severity of type one errors. The Blackstonian philosophy of criminal justice overstates the protection of the innocent, while experience tells us that the Blackstonian ratio is not useful in this context. We need to reflect not just on the hardship of exoneration, but why theorists’ and the public’s outrage have not reduced unnecessary incarceration, and why it is so hard for innocent people to challenge incorrect verdicts after trial. The more we speak about what is worse, the more difficult it becomes to save the innocent, while the less importance we place on sanctioning the guilty, the more danger there is to the community. This arises because, while a paradox that is different from our perceptions ‘helps us make sense of the world, it can actively undermine our ability to understand it’.163 The second contribution of this research is the evidence supporting the theoretical argument that it is necessary to focus on the detriment of wrongful liberty and to justify the crime control model. Criminals who have been wrongly freed may have the chance to commit more crime and endanger the community. When we compare the wrongful liberty rate with the wrongful conviction rate, the Blackstone principle actually causes a great deal of harm. We therefore need the criminal control model to have a place in criminal proceedings. The third contribution of this work is the factual evidence from findings regarding public opinion. Using data from the ISSP between 1985 and 2016, in this article, I have explored the relationship between the preference for two types of judicial error and public support for actions taken by the police to catch criminals or terrorists. The multivariate analysis has also shown that support for detaining offenders is lower from those focusing on the detriment of type one errors, and vice versa. By reviewing wrongful liberty, it can be assumed that, if criminal justice around the world makes crime controllable, the public may not treat type two errors as the worst type. The fourth contribution is a reminder of the theoretical danger regarding absolute opponents to authorities’ reactions to public safety in a risk society. The phenomenon of supporting no measures undertaken by the police without a court order has increased by a quarter of citizens. This is partially related to the philosophy of Blackstone and due process, which concern legal and moral justifications for society and individual rights. Public sentiment is easily influenced by significant numbers of wrongful convictions, particularly due to the mass media. If Packerites and Blackstonians consider current and potential victims, it is necessary to control crime by stopping every crime at the earliest second, rather than at the last minute. Judicial recognition of public safety is a priority and may justify proactive measures such as the crime control model. Societies around the world are encountering a new challenge given criminals’ high level of mobility and our vulnerability to the risk of victimization.164",

    "abstract": "This article examines the implications of the South China Sea Arbitration (“the SCS Arbitration”) for the governance of the Arctic Ocean. It argues that the SCS Arbitration award is more than a “piece of paper” and carries important implications for assessing and resolving maritime disputes and disagreements in the Arctic, especially regarding four maritime issues: (1) the historic claims in the Arctic Ocean, (2) the legal status of maritime features in the Arctic Ocean, (3) the application of straight baselines to outlying archipelagos in the Arctic Ocean, and (4) the adjudication of Arctic maritime disputes in international courts and tribunals. In the Arctic Ocean, many claims and practices of several Arctic states are arguably inconsistent with the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) and the findings of the SCS Arbitration Tribunal. Several Arctic states have endorsed the SCS Arbitration award and called for China and the Philippines to abide by it. However, they have not altered their own practices in light of the SCS Arbitration ruling. This double-standard approach to international law is not new in many states' practices but constitutes a significant challenge for constraining maritime states' creeping claims in the sea all around the world. Taken together, by revisiting some key maritime disagreements in the Arctic Ocean in light of the SCS Arbitration award, this article offers critical insights into current opportunities and challenges for constraining powerful states' expansion in the sea.",
    "conclusion": "This article has revisited some key maritime disputes and disagreements in the Arctic Ocean in light of the South China Sea Arbitration ruling. It argues that the SCS Arbitration award is more than a “piece of paper” and has considerable legal implications for assessing and resolving maritime disputes in the Arctic, especially with respect to four issues: (1) the historic maritime claims in the Arctic Ocean, (2) the legal status and maritime entitlement of Arctic maritime features, (3) the application of straight baselines around outlying archipelagos in the Arctic Ocean, and (4) the adjudication of some Arctic maritime disputes in international courts or tribunals. In doing so, this article particularly hopes to offer some critical insights into the existing opportunities and challenges for constraining maritime states’ creeping claims in the sea. The SCS Arbitration demonstrated that weak states with limited control over their territories and resources have increasingly fought their battles in the court rooms of international tribunals. This can prompt powerful states to clarify their claims and actions under international law.309 The increasing judicialization of international law also provides good opportunities for international courts and tribunals to consider various contentious fundamental issues of global order and play important roles in developing international law.",

    "abstract": "A growing body of research suggests that authoritarian regimes are responsive to societal actors, but our understanding of the sources of authoritarian responsiveness remains limited because of the challenges of measurement and causal identification. By conducting an online field experiment among 2,103 Chinese counties, we examine factors that affect officials' incentives to respond to citizens in an authoritarian context. At baseline, we find that approximately one-third of county governments respond to citizen demands expressed online. Threats of collective action and threats of tattling to upper levels of government cause county governments to be considerably more responsive, whereas identifying as loyal, long-standing members of the Chinese Communist Party does not increase responsiveness. Moreover, we find that threats of collective action make local officials more publicly responsive. Together, these results demonstrate that top-down mechanisms of oversight as well as bottom-up societal pressures are possible sources of authoritarian responsiveness.",
    "conclusion": "Using an online field experiment to directly measure the responsiveness of subnational officials to citizen requests, we find that almost one-third of county governments in China are responsive to citizen requests related to social welfare. We find that threatening collective action causes a 10 percentage point increase in the overall response rate (or a 30% increase in the overall response rate), a 10 percentage point increase in the probability of providing a publicly viewable response, and a 6 percentage point increase in receiving direct, detailed responses. In contrast, while threatening to complain to upper levels of government causes a 8 percentage point increase in overall responsiveness, these threats of tattling have no detectable causal effect on publicly viewable responses. Finally, deferential claims of long-standing loyalty to the CCP do not on average cause increases in responsiveness. While the Chinese regime may be particularly sensitive to citizen engagement and while the Chinese state may have outsized capacity to engage in information gathering and to respond to societal actors compared to other authoritarian regimes, responsiveness is an increasingly familiar refrain heard among state actors across many authoritarian regimes. Whether it is driven by a concern for regime stability or due to the influence of international organizations, regimes from the Middle East and North Africa to East and Southeast Asia are increasingly stressing the importance of responsiveness and some form of accountability to citizens (Harris 2013; Malesky and Schuler 2010; Reilly 2013).30 For scholars focused on other regions of the world, our work shows that in the absence of meaningful electoral competition, responsiveness could stem from top-down mechanisms of oversight, which we may expect in authoritarian regimes with higher degrees of top-down control and discipline, but responsiveness could also stem from bottom-up pressures from citizen engagement through channels set up by the regime (in our case, forums on government websites). Furthermore, our work shows that top-down mechanisms of oversight are activated by citizen input, that it is the interactions between top-down mechanisms of oversight and citizen engagement that generate authoritarian responsiveness, pointing to a possible refinement of existing theories. Upper-level authorities use citizens as an oversight mechanism on subnational officials, which imbues citizens with the ability to sanction lower-level officials and generates responsiveness among local officials to citizen demands. These results show that regardless of whether responsiveness derives from top-down mechanisms or bottom-up pressures, citizen engagement is consequential. Citizen engagement provides information that officials pay attention to, and it can result in greater levels of governmental attention and response. Uncontrolled engagement is often a concern for authoritarian regimes, and authoritarian responsiveness appears to be one attempt at diffusing societal tensions and maintaining regime durability.",

    "abstract": "This study examines legal opportunity in China after the recent “law-based governance” reforms, including those that have professionalized the judiciary, established NGOs' public interest standing, and expanded legal aid coverage. Based on in-depth interviews, it finds that despite the generally tightening political control over the social sector, the reforms have helped some law-related NGOs expand their litigation practice, social and legislative influence, and domestic funding sources. At the same time, these changes have had considerable cooptation effects by aligning these NGOs' interests with the state's and channeling their activities into state-sanctioned institutional processes. The findings suggest that states can effectively utilize a dualist strategy that combines restrictive and supportive approaches to public participation in the legal process. It thus sheds light on the progression of legality within various political and institutional contexts.",
    "conclusion": "The current research presents a picture of China selectively improving the legal opportunity for various types of law-related NGOs. This has been achieved mostly through a recent series of legal reforms under the umbrella of law-based governance, a central element of the current administration’s agenda. Chief among these reforms is the new PIL standing bestowed by the 2014 Revision to the Environmental Protection Law, which enables large environmental NGOs to significantly expand their litigation practices. Other substantive legislation-such as the Anti-Domestic Violence Law and the Charity Law-also grant relevant NGOs opportunities to establish or grow their legal operations. Additionally, NGOs engaged in legal aid can now benefit from the new Legal Aid Law and the government’s increased investment in their work. These NGOs also generally find the judiciary more amenable to their demands, due largely to the recent judicial reforms. For instance, the case registration system has substantially decreased the chance that courts will reject NGOs’ cases during the pre-trial stage. The interviewed NGO lawyers also reported increasingly encountering judges who are more professional and respectful of their trial rights, thanks to the judicial personnel and responsibility reforms. In particular, those from environmental NGOs credited their vastly improved trial experiences to the many newly established environmental tribunals consisting of sympathetic judges well trained in the field of environmental law. In addition, the legal reforms have helped some law-related NGOs improve their finances, legislative influence, and media relations. These reform measures-including the new PIL standing and legal aid policies-have brought new sources of funding to law-related NGOs in the form of donations and government- or court-issued legal fees. The improved legal opportunity also allows NGOs to participate more effectively in the legislative process through the strategic use of impact litigation. Similarly, the expansion of NGOs’ litigation practices affords them a politically safe channel for gaining media exposure-and thus social influence-despite increasing censorship.",

    "abstract": "Intellectual property drives much of America's economy.1 China has sought to reap the same benefit2 for their own economy not by developing intellectual property, but by misappropriating it from the United States.3 This theft of American intellectual property is a pervasive problem, and it has grown progressively worse over the past twenty years.4 In 2019, 20% of U.S. CFO council companies reported theft within the prior year,5 and such theft totaled around half a trillion dollars.6 Part I of this Note will provide the backdrop for this continued looting, including tracing its history throughout the last few decades and outlining its extensive scope. Part II of this Note will address the chief avenues that make such blatant theft possible, including (i) China's intrusion into U.S. academia, and (ii) the transparency required with state-run Chinese companies. Even with this acceleration of theft in recent years, however, there has been little to no development in the *195 ability to curtail it.7 So, Part III will explore solutions to address those gaps in policy concerning intellectual property enforcement and protection. This will take a two-pronged analysis: first, from an American domestic policy perspective-namely the implementation of trade restrictions and higher education reform-then, from an international law perspective, such as increasing the availability of remedies within the Chinese courts and utilizing European allies to apply pressure on infringing governments.",
    "conclusion": "For the last few decades, China has been engaged in the wholesale theft of American intellectual property. Having invaded U.S. research institutions and pierced the protective walls of some of the largest American companies, China has reaped the benefits, numbered in the trillions of dollars, while facing almost zero repercussions. Trade policies and tailored technology controls, both domestic and along with European allies, can pressure China to clean up its deceptive trade practices and to reform its court system. Furthermore, by shoring up areas of potential security breaches and tightening down on prosecutions in American courts, through the use of statutes covering trade secret theft and tax and wire fraud to common law doctrines like breach of contract, the U.S. can at least begin to reclaim its valuable intellectual property and offer its companies the protections they are promised and rightly deserve. There is likely no singular or one-size-fits-all solution, but utilizing a combination of the proposed solutions in this Note will hopefully offer a way forward that will allow the U.S. to remain at the cutting edge of technological advancement and provide a chance for them to compete with China and the rest of the world in an actual “fair market.",

    "abstract": "Land expropriation, where peasants’ property rights are encroached by the state, has been recognized as a primary source of social dissension in rural China. Since the end of the last century, the Administrative Litigation Law (ALL) has provided people with a legal weapon to defend themselves against violations by state power. Drawing on the theory of relative deprivation, this paper proposes that peasants are more likely to sue the state when they feel deprived. To examine this hypothesis, we first present a case study to depict the causal process and then use quantitative research to improve the external validity of our findings. We created a novel and unique database of prefecture-level administrative litigations and relative deprivation for Poisson regression analysis. The quantitative results prove that the more peasants feel relatively deprived, the more likely they are to sue the state. Furthermore, the positive effect of relative deprivation on administrative litigations has become more significant over time, implying peasants’ growing awareness of legal resistance. This paper concludes that a critical step towards eliminating social inequity and maintaining social stability in rural China is to reduce the relative deprivation of peasants by, for example, allowing them to share in land value appreciation in the process of urbanization.",
    "conclusion": "In recent decades, land expropriation has given rise to antagonism between peasants and local governments in rural China. According to the social psychology literature, people's grievances and dissension are highly related to their relative deprivation, which is generated when people make comparisons between what they have gained and what they think they should have gained. In the context of land expropriation, peasants receive compensation but are almost completely excluded from a share of the appreciation in the land value gained through the conversion of its use. The gap between compensation offered for land expropriation and the market value of land is at the root of an important source of relative deprivation. With such a hypothesis in mind, this paper aims to uncover the relationship between relative deprivation and peasants’ resistance behaviour. Taking advantage of the openness of judicial documents, we focus on a specific pattern of resistance - administrative litigation. We created a unique database of the number of administrative litigation cases and the index of relative deprivation for each prefecture in each year. The regression results show that relative deprivation significantly contributes to the increase in land expropriation-related administrative litigation cases, implying that peasants are more likely to sue the state when they feel deprived. The dynamic analysis reveals a gradually increasing effect of relative deprivation, which could be viewed as peasants’ growing right consciousness.",

    "abstract": "All developing countries face the problem of how to build the legal and institutional infrastructure (for example, securing property rights and the rule of law) necessary to support efficient markets. The historic path for the West involved parliaments and independent judiciaries that constrained the ruler. China’s path has differed considerably; from the beginning, it involved “federalism, Chinese style.” This Article explains how private actors are devising new institutional rules in China that hold the promise of creating what we call “law, Chinese style.” Taobao-China’s dominant online trading platform with over four hundred million users-is not simply an exchange platform, but one in the process of developing a modern legal system that enforces contracts, resolves disputes, and prevents fraud. We argue that the delegation implicit in law, Chinese style, parallels China’s earlier reforms during the 1980s and early 1990s that helped create federalism, Chinese style. In parallel with the earlier delegation, the new form of delegation also involves the delegation of authority and policy experimentation. Importantly, this approach to legal development is much less politically constraining on the central government than the Western approach. Additionally, the emergence of Taobao’s national market has important political and economic effects, especially with respect to federalism. From the beginning of the reform process, the Chinese common market has been hindered by internal trade barriers. Taobao’s national market holds the potential to circumvent internal trade barriers and grant tens of millions of rural people access to markets previously beyond their grasp. As Taobao becomes larger in user base, it gains more political clout with the central government-and it is more likely to raise suspicions from the government as well. It remains to be seen, therefore, whether, and to what extent, Taobao and the central government will be able to continue their collaboration as circumstances change.",
    "conclusion": "We asked two questions at the outset: (1) What is the scope of Taobao’s law-creation? and (2) What effects is Taobao likely to have on federalism, Chinese style, and the common market? Online market platforms, such as Taobao, appear to be changing the politics, economics, and legal infrastructure of China. We argued that Taobao has created far more than an exchange system; it has created a national market platform, including the market infrastructure necessary to sustain markets that the central government has found it difficult to provide. We called this phenomenon law, Chinese style. Law, Chinese style, has emerged because the central government in China has effectively delegated the authority to develop this infrastructure to private parties. This delegation gives the central government several advantages: it provides an institutional basis for markets in a weak rule-of-law environment; it permits experimentation; and it also allows the central government to distance itself from any failures. We drew connections between these benefits and the advantages that characterize federalism, Chinese style-one that existed during the early reform efforts in the 1980s and early 1990s. But, unlike federalism, Chinese style, this new system of creating a national market through private online platforms seems to tip the power balance towards the central government, rather than the other way around. On the one hand, Taobao holds the potential to circumvent internal trade barriers between provinces by fostering a national online market. While the rise of a national common market is likely to generate substantial economic growth, it has begun to challenge the regulatory power of local governments, as now many problems are no longer localized. On the other hand, the rise of national platforms such as Taobao seems to help reinforce the power of the central government. The central government can use national platforms as centralized tools to collect market information and to enforce central policies. As Taobao grows, however, it will become a force that can potentially demand concessions from the central government. Were the central government to shut down and expropriate Taobao’s assets, it would face 400 million doomed citizens whose interests the government has trampled. Even if Taobao may not intend to challenge the central authority, its growing influence may invite unwanted suspicions from the latter. It is not at all clear whether these two parties will collaborate or end up in conflict. It is too early to tell whether these trends will continue and add up to something important and transforming. But law, Chinese style, holds the potential for such a transformation.",

    "abstract": "Concerns are growing both within the Biden Administration and in Congress over a potential flood of low-priced electric vehicles (EVs) from China, directly or, more likely, via third countries such as Mexico. BYD, a leading Chinese producer, has announced in spring 2024 that it intends to establish production facilities in Mexico soon, with an initial capacity of 150,000 cars annually, although in August it reportedly deferred those plans until after the U.S. presidential election.1 While BYD has contended that such production would be for the local Mexican market and for export to the more than fifty countries with which Mexico has free trade agreements, observers believe that the U.S. market is the real prize given its enormous size, with more than 15.5 million auto and light trucks sold in 2023. This article begins with a brief discussion of the current situation and remedial legal and practical measures likely to be applied to trade in passenger vehicles under the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) and relevant World Trade Organization (WTO) law. This is followed by the rationale for BYD and perhaps other Chinese auto producers to build factories in Mexico, the legal and practical options for BYD and other Chinese autos and SUVs assembled in Mexico to enter the U.S. market, and the trade remedy and national security actions available to the U.S. government to exclude those imports from entering the United States. Finally, this *74 article examines the implications of the exclusion policies that appear likely to be followed by either Democratic or Republican administrations in the foreseeable future and offers some recommendations.",
    "conclusion": "While there are few certainties and frequent surprises in U.S.-China trade relations, it is highly likely in my view that the U.S. government will soon extend its measures now applicable to direct imports under Section 301 to exclude Chinese-made indirect EV exports (principally expected from Mexico), from the U.S. auto market. Current concerns over potential Chinese spying and data theft, along with those relating to protecting U.S. auto producers and their workers from possibly ruinous competition, along with 2024 election politics, are overwhelming.259 While the most direct route to this goal is probably through national security tools, a variety of trade and tariff tools are also available. In this respect, at least with Chinese-produced autos from Mexico, the United States has at least a year to choose one or more such actions and implement them in the normal manner.",

    "abstract": "Scholars of law, economics, and political science argue that collegiality matters. Considerable panel effects exist across jurisdictions, and judges compose panels strategically. In China, millions of cases are decided by collegial panels every year; however, little attention has been paid to the issue of collegiality. We offer one of the first empirical inquiries into collegial panels in China. Specifically, when and why do judges engage in collegiality? How does the presiding judge compose a judicial panel? What is the panel effect? Based on 23,564 cases decided by a local court in Beijing, China, from 2015 to 2017, we build a network of judges' collegial behaviors and examine the judges' strategy for panel composition and its potential impact. We argue for an external mechanism of panel effects and provide a strategic account of coalition-building in a vulnerable environment. For mundane cases, Chinese judges tend to compose panels with junior judges. To some extent, such panels are their comfort zone. When facing complex cases, they tend to step out of their comfort zone and form panels with more capable judges. When doing so, they are also more inclined to make tough decisions, such as ruling against the government in administrative litigation cases and repeated players in civil cases, among others. The study sheds light on judicial politics in China and has the potential to expand our understanding of collective judicial decision-making in transitional societies.",
    "conclusion": "Based on published DADs and fieldwork in a Beijing local court, this study examines when and how Chinese judges engage in collegiality. Specifically, we reveal the intriguing panel effects in Chinese courts: when judges venture out of their comfort zone-that is, when they compose panels with “star” judges or court leaders-they tend to reach tough decisions. For ALCs, as the cooperation ratio decreases, the panels are more likely to rule against the government. Similarly, in civil cases, strategically composed panels tend to favor one-shotters over repeated players or make more extreme decisions. In criminal cases, decreased cooperation ratios among panel judges lead to more severe and fewer suspended sentences. The underlying mechanism behind such panel effects is Chinese judges' strategic consideration when facing complex cases. For ordinary cases, presiding judges are more inclined to improvise judicial panels with their junior colleagues. These cases constitute their comfort zone, where they can easily steer the case disposition while tutoring young judges. When handling complex cases, however, presiding judges tend to spare extra efforts to huddle with “star” judges or court leaders. To our best knowledge, this is one of the first empirical examinations of judges' collegial behaviors in China.",

    "abstract": "This article is the first to systematically study and compare the criminal repression of civic NGOs under the rule of Hu Jintao and Xi Jinping. The crackdown is analyzed against the evolution of NGO governance strategy that has bifurcated into co-option and repression. Under Xi’s administration, the mode of repression has escalated from hooligan-style intimidation to law-based systematic crackdown, facilitated by an increasingly authoritarian legality. Underlying this escalation is the paradigm shift of governance strategy from ‘maintaining stability’ to ‘consolidating state security.’ Consequently, NGOs with evident pro-liberal inclination, mass mobilization capacities, and/or closer associations with ‘hostile forces’ are most vulnerable to persecution. This article concludes by gauging the impact of the crackdown on advocacy NGOs and suggesting possible scenarios for future rights activism.",
    "conclusion": "The article concludes that Xi’s administration has transformed NGO governance from sporadic intimidation under Hu Jintao into a law-based, systematic crackdown aimed at consolidating state security. This escalation involves systematized national campaigns, ambiguous “pocket crime” charges, public confessions, and stigmatization tactics. Advocacy NGOs with pro-liberal stances, mobilization capacity, or foreign ties are most vulnerable. The crackdown has fragmented and weakened civil society but also forced NGOs to adopt innovative, community-sensitive strategies for survival",

    "abstract": "Empirical research indicates that, in the fields of invalidation of an illegal contract, the most commonly invalidated contracts [in China] are (housing) sales contracts, land usage rights (sell or transfer) contracts, construction contracts, (housing) rent contracts, land contracting contracts, and loan contracts. The most common contractual elements violating mandatory provisions are illegal subjects of contracts (qualification) and illegal objects of contracts. The most common mandatory provisions subject to such violations are those provisions related to the right to use collective land in rural areas, lacking construction qualifications, lacking credit loan qualifications, unregistered real estate, the disposition of illegal construction. In practice, mandatory provisions are commonly misread and inconsistently determined, especially in contracts involving unauthorized disposition, transfer of unregistered real estate or houses built on rural homestead, contracts signed by parties without qualifications, contracts where one party involved in economic crimes. To improve the regime of contractual invalidation in China, we should legalize the reference of mandatory provisions, adopt a uniform criterion [in identifying mandatory provisions], narrow down the scope of application, and separate the civil and criminal trial practices.",
    "conclusion": "The article concludes that the invalidation of illegal contracts in China occurs mainly due to violations of administrative and economic law, particularly land management, construction qualifications, loan restrictions, and real estate regulations. Courts often confuse administrative “shall not” clauses with validity requirements, leading to inconsistent judgments. Ye suggests narrowing the scope of mandatory provisions, applying consistent standards, avoiding excessive criminal law extension into civil disputes, and relying more on interest-balancing frameworks. The study emphasizes categorization plus balancing of interests as the legislative approach, but also highlights the need for empirical observation to support theoretical reforms",

    "abstract": "While China engages in world commerce as a global player and is signatory to international labor and human rights standards, at the same time it uses treaty reservations and its own domestic laws to limit and undermine the full application of those standards. Concern from Western governments and global human rights groups regarding China’s longstanding treatment of the Uyghur people has resulted in a freeze in negotiations for the EU-China Comprehensive Investment Agreement (CAI). This was also a result of China’s failure to ratify or implement relevant United Nations (U.N.) covenants and International Labour Organization (ILO) conventions and placing reservations or domestic legal barriers on them, as well as foreign accusations of forced labor. Now that China has recently ratified ILO Convention Nos. 29 and 105 prohibiting forced labor, what will be the effect on the currently frozen negotiations of the EU-China CAI, now at an impasse due to issues relating to China’s alleged discrimination and forced labor treatment of Uyghurs in Xinjiang, China? In unbundling the legalities of this stalled draft agreement, this paper progressively examines the global obligations of the U.N. covenants and ILO conventions, as well as relevant provisions in the draft CAI, in the context of the Chinese approach to international labor and human rights standards, including the EU’s emerging due diligence laws and the 2021 Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act in the U.S.",
    "conclusion": "The article concludes that although China has ratified two ILO conventions prohibiting forced labor, its reliance on domestic legal reservations and continued human rights violations, especially in Xinjiang, raise doubts about its compliance. The EU-China CAI remains frozen, and the paper suggests that only through stronger enforcement mechanisms, domestic legislation, and international cooperation can human rights protections be advanced. The future of the CAI will depend on whether China demonstrates substantive implementation of labor rights beyond formal ratifications.",

    "abstract": "In recognition of data’s growing significance as a corporate asset, Chinese authorities have embarked on a strategic initiative to regulate data usage and safeguard individual privacy and rights. As Beijing increasingly prioritizes national security interests, the Chinese government is enhancing its data security regulations to address national security concerns. The changes have led to greater scrutiny of cross-border data transfers, as well stricter regulations for multinational firms in China. This Article seeks to clarify the complexities of China’s data laws while emphasizing how companies should enhance their understanding of these regulatory nuances. Adopting a proactive stance and implementing rigorous compliance strategies are essential for multinational companies in China to protect their business interests within the context of this changing framework.",
    "conclusion": "As China continues to develop its data transfer and privacy laws, navigating this complex labyrinth of regulations remains a critical challenge for multinational corporations. The recent shifts in China’s legal framework, particularly in the realms of cybersecurity, data privacy, and cross-border data transfers, reflect the country’s increasing emphasis on national security affairs. Nevertheless, the recent release of the 2023 Draft Provisions also indicates a level of willingness to balance this emphasis with the practical considerations of spurring business activity. … The proactive adoption of rigorous compliance strategies, coupled with a keen understanding of the nuances of China’s legal environment, will be pivotal for businesses looking to thrive in this dynamic market. Staying informed and remaining agile in response to any future changes will be key for businesses to successfully scale the great cyberwall.",

    "abstract": "In 2019, New Zealand signed a Double Tax Agreement with China, with the purpose of alleviating the burden of double tax on cross-border transactions, as well as preventing international tax evasion and avoidance. The 2019 Double Tax Agreement replaces the 1986 version, which was one of China's first tax treaties signed after its entrance into the global market. At that time, China had a “Great Wall” protecting its tax base from other jurisdictions, which was evident in its DTAs. Between 1986 and 2019, China became one of the world's largest and most influential economies. A close examination of the 2019 Double Tax Agreement sheds light on the evolving relationship between New Zealand and its largest trading partner. In 2019, it became New Zealand who negotiated as if it had a “Great Wall” to protect and retain an adequate tax base. New Zealand can be seen to diverge further than expected from the OECD's Double Tax Agreement Model for developed countries in respect to its negotiations with China. At the same time, China's treaty practice has increasingly converged with the OECD approach. Furthermore, the 2019 Double Tax Agreement indicates the growing maturity of China's tax system and China's willingness to combat base erosion and profit shifting. New Zealand's indiscriminatory policy to foreign direct investment and free trading of goods means New Zealand is becoming increasingly reliant on China for capital and economic growth. How has a developing nation changed New Zealand's tax treaty policy? This is the question this article seeks to address.",

    "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) application in the judiciary has initiated the historical process of moving from access to justice (ATJ) to \"visible justice\" and has profoundly changed the judicial operation mechanism. The judiciary's visualization, codification, modularization, and intellectualization are reshaping the judicial procedure and greatly improving the efficiency of intelligent justice. But Judicial AI (JAI) still has its inherent limits. It is not easy to achieve absolute objectivity and accuracy in algorithmic decision-making, and in more complex cases, JAI can promote formal justice but not substantive justice. The judiciary's AI optimization and reshaping effect should be developed simultaneously with risk prevention. It is necessary to establish corresponding regulations and relief mechanisms for algorithmic decision-making and to infuse the concepts of openness, fairness, and responsibility to promote science and technology for goods and positive development of intelligent justice to realize \"visible justice.\"",
    "conclusion": "The forward prospect and reverse reflection of JAI in this paper is not a logical game of dichotomy but aims to analyze its possible scope and limitation. Indeed, the author is optimistic about the progress and prospects of JAI, but, in turn, that is why such research on its scope and limitation is needed for its reasonable positioning and scientific empowerment. AI's optimization and reshaping effect on the judiciary should be carried out simultaneously with risk preventions. It is necessary to establish corresponding regulations and relief mechanisms for algorithmic decision-making and to infuse the concepts of openness, fairness, and responsibility to promote science and technology for goods and positive development of intelligent justice to realize \"visible justice.\"",

Algorithmic decision-making can optimize litigation procedures and handle simple cases through procedural and formulaic calculations but cannot handle important complex cases; it can promote formal justice but cannot achieve substantive justice. Algorithms may be competent for many tasks in the courtroom but are not competent for judgment processes (96) such as guidelines for evidence standard, condition review, error correction, and judgment deviation prompts, processes in which algorithms can only be auxiliary tools for human decision-making. Humans are still the ones who make the critical and final calls. (97) Perhaps, with the development of AI technology, algorithms would undertake more work in decision-making, but it is still a judicial assistant and a working partner, not an independent judge. Even if the singularity of the strong AI age arrives, humans can still reposition themselves to embrace such a moment.",

    "abstract": "This article studies the consequences of digital surveillance in dictatorships. I first develop an informational theory of repression and co-optation. I argue that digital surveillance resolves dictators’ information problem of not knowing individual citizens’ true anti-regime sentiments. By identifying radical opponents, digital surveillance enables dictators to substitute targeted repression for nonexclusive co-optation to forestall coordinated uprisings. My theory implies that as digital surveillance technologies advance, we should observe a rise in targeted repression and a decline in universal redistribution. Using a difference-in-differences design that exploits temporal variation in digital surveillance systems among Chinese counties, I find that surveillance increases local governments’ public security expenditure and arrests of political activists but decreases public goods provision. My theory and evidence suggest that improvements in governments’ information make citizens worse off in dictatorships.",
    "conclusion": "Today, roughly half of the world’s population lives under some form of nondemocratic government. Although social scientists, policy makers, and human rights advocates celebrated the dawn of the Internet era in the hopes that better communication technology would become a powerful tool to ensure and encourage freedom and democracy, we have not observed widespread authoritarian collapse in the two decades since the advent of this era. In this article, I argue that digital surveillance empowers dictators by resolving their information problem in identifying radical opponents and enabling them to substitute preventive repression for co-optation to prevent social unrest. The evidence from analyzing the effects of the Golden Shield Project on Chinese subnational governments’ repression and co-optation is consistent with this theory. The findings of this article are based on the practices of surveillance and repression conducted by the police in a non-electoral dictatorship, but the theory developed here is generalizable to other types of surveillance and repression as well as to electoral autocracies. For example, in 2004, the Hugo Chávez regime in Venezuela was able to identify several million voters who had attempted to remove him from office. The regime then used a user-friendly software program known as Maisanta to distribute the list throughout the government bureaucracy for punishment. Scholars find that voters who were identified as Chávez opponents experienced a 5% drop in earnings and a 1.3 percentage point drop in employment rates after the voter list was released. This case suggests that dictators have many ways to surveil and repress opponents, and surveillance can be effective when it is used to collect individual-level information on citizens’ political preferences during elections. The theory and findings in this article have several implications for explaining authoritarian survival in the digital age. First, digital surveillance helps dictators repress radical opponents to forestall large-scale, social protests that might threaten their survival. Second, contemporary dictatorships seldom employ large-scale, in-person surveillance (e.g., Stasi in East Germany) to control society due to its detrimental effects on social trust and economic growth as well as the costs and risks of creating and managing a large bureaucracy composed of human agents who may threaten the dictator’s survival. Digital surveillance relies less on human agents and can more easily be disguised. The reduced social and political costs facilitate using surveillance to control society in dictatorships. Moreover, surveillance enables dictators to use preventive repression to address threats before overt mass protests mobilize, which reduces the necessity to engage in reactive, often more violent, state-led repression. As a consequence, surveillance likely reduces dictators’ reliance on military or paramilitary forces for retaining power and therefore lowers the risk of military takeover. Future research in these directions is worth exploration.",

    "abstract": "This Note examines the current state of biometric AI usage and regulation in the United States, China, and the European Union. It analyzes and compares the United States’ legal framework with the approaches employed by China and the European Union to construct an ideal framework for avoiding the destruction of our privacy and erosion of our civil liberties. It will examine all biometric data types and uses, with a focus on facial recognition and similar biometrics that can be used for remote identification.",
    "conclusion": "This century, tension between harnessing technology and protecting individual rights will continually recur. Americans should have the same minimum expectation of privacy whether they live in Illinois or New York, or whether they are walking down the street or in a store. Individuals should be able to attend a protest, event, or other lawful activity, without fear of being remotely identified and having that data aggregated with other personal data-a fear so strong that they may decide to stay home instead. They should feel comfortable that a level of obscurity will be built into technology used by companies or governments and that government officials will need probable cause before they can access this wealth of information. Congress should pass legislation built around protecting obscurity to avoid the possible chill on civil rights and the other myriad harms of biometric authentication, identification, characterization, and detection.",

    "abstract": "Scholarship on the Chinese party state commonly treats the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) as a black box: the Party acts in the world, using the law as its tool to achieve its political goals. The study of intra-party regulations turns this anthropomorphic image inside out, requiring scholars to regard the very notion of the Party and rule-based governance as ideologically and theoretically contentious matters. This article maps out-and criticizes-prominent approaches to the study of intra-party regulations and rule-based governance within the CCP. It is certainly possible to explain CCP intra-party regulations through external social theoretical perspectives, such as Ernst Fraenkel’s dual state model. However, such perspectives do not necessarily help one understand the CCP leaders’ and ideologues’ idiosyncratic approach to rule-based governance. Fraenkel’s dual state model, in particular, fails to fully describe the role of rule-based governance in the CCP’s governance project.",
    "conclusion": "In conclusion, there is no self-evident way to describe the role of rule-based governance within the CCP. An attempt to explain the Party leadership’s approach through textually authentic formulations would appear unhelpful to a foreign audience; conversely, external theoretical explanations risk misrepresenting the Party’s idiosyncratic views. One might be tempted to argue that a balance between internal and external explanations could help outsiders understand intra-party regulations, but perhaps there is no such balance. The theoretical challenge stems from the Party’s ideological premises: the CCP is a political organization modeled after the same political organizations it seeks to overcome. In this process, the Party implements rule-transcending leadership through formal rules, until it does not. Ultimately, Marxism-Leninism-and any ideology-must be accepted as a matter of faith.",

    "abstract": "Studies of local governance in China often point to nimble experimentation but problematic implementation. To reconcile these competing images, it is useful to clarify the concepts of experimentation and implementation and see how they unfolded in one policy area. The history of China’s Open Government Information (OGI) initiative shows that the experimentation stage sometimes proceeds well and produces new policy options, but may falter if local leaders are unwilling to carry out an experiment. And the implementation stage often poses challenges, but may improve if the Center initiates new, small-scale experiments and encourages local innovation. This suggests that the experimentation and implementation stages are not so different when officials in Beijing and the localities have diverging interests and the Center is more supportive of a measure than local officials. The ups and downs of OGI, and also village elections, can be traced to the policy goal of monitoring local cadres, the central-local divide, and the pattern of support and opposition within the state",
    "conclusion": "The policy dynamic described in the previous sections does not square well with the image of a smooth experimentation stage and an implementation stage beset with problems. The first 20 years of OGI experimentation were somewhat rocky mainly because local officials were worried about public scrutiny and potential embarrassment, and thus reluctant to cooperate with central experiments. And despite the misgivings of local cadres, the implementation era has proceeded surprisingly well after more experiments were conducted, higher levels accommodated local concerns, and cadres innovated and came to accept the Center’s clearer and less trying demands. Rather than an account of reliably successful and unsuccessful stages of the policy process, OGI is a story of ups and downs throughout, which can be traced to the central-local divide, the nature of OGI, and its aim of promoting openness. OGI has always been a top-down effort to monitor localities that the Center was more enthusiastic about than local officials. Although efforts to take into account cadres’ concerns have narrowed the differences between the two parties and reduced opposition during the implementation era, tensions between actors who have different preferences and goals can never be completely finessed. From beginning to end, a conflict of interests has driven actions on both sides.",

Results show that support for the death penalty in China remains high, but that knowledge and exposure to information significantly reduce such support. These findings suggest that even in China, where the state controls information about the death penalty, better-informed citizens are less punitive and more cautious about capital punishment.

    "abstract": "Through a quantitative analysis of Taiwan-related legislation between 1979 and 2020, the article finds that the degree of Taiwan-related legislation is significantly correlated with the degree of tension in U.S.-China relations. While a deteriorating cross-Taiwan Strait relationship is clearly associated with the increasing legislative activities for the sake of Taiwan, an improving relationship from the state of fair to good cannot guarantee a decrease of such activities. A unified government and the extent of the Taiwan lobby are both helpful in passing pro-Taiwan acts but statistically insignificant. A content analysis of pro-Taiwan bills approved by the Trump administration suggests a creeping movement to “normalize” U. S-Taiwan relations with congressional activism and the less-restrained White House as a co-engine.",
    "conclusion": "This article assumes that congressional promotion of Taiwan-related legislation from 1979 to 2020 is shaped by executive-legislative interactions, U.S.-China relations, cross-Strait ties, and the Taiwan lobby. Through a quantitative cross-tabling analysis, it finds that a divided Congress is negatively correlated with Taiwan-related legislative activities while a unified government is more productive in passing acts. The second hypothesis that the worse U.S.-China relations, the higher degree of Taiwan-related legislation is verified statistically. The third hypothesis that the worse cross-Strait relations, the higher degree of pro-Taiwan legislation is partly verified. While bad cross-Strait relations tend to induce more Taiwan-related legislation, a fair relationship (neither too bad nor too good) between the two sides tends to discourage Taiwan-related legislation, suggesting that Congress would be quieter when cross-Strait relations are in a fair period. The fourth hypothesis that more Taiwanese money for lobby tends to produce more Taiwan-related legislation cannot be 40See the statement at Press Release, ‘Pelosi Statement on Passage of TAIPEI Act,’ Speaker.gov, March 4, 2020, accessed March 11, 2020, https://www.speaker.gov/newsroom/3420-1. 41Lindsay, ‘Congress and Foreign Policy,’ p. 612. 42U.S. Department of State, A Free and Open Indo-Pacific: Advancing a Shared Vision (Washington, DC: Bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs, 2019), p. 8. 43National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020 (Washington, DC: U.S. Government Publishing Office, 2019); Congressional Record, 1 January 2020, accessed 26 March 2020, https://www.congress.gov/116/crec/2021/01/01/CREC-2021- 01-01-pt1-PgS8000.pdf. JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY CHINA 623 verified statistically because of incomplete dada. Data analysis from a macro perspective, however, could be supplemented by thick description for a better understanding of congressional promotion of Taiwan-related legislation. A study of Taiwan-related legislation during the Trump administration confirms that the two of the four variables, U.S.-China relations and cross-Strait ties are more accountable than the other two. A weakly divided government in 2019 and 2020 cannot reduce congressional involvement in legislation concerning Taiwan. This does not suggest, however, that executive-legislative relations are irrelevant at all. It is simply because the simultaneous deterioration of U.S.-China and cross-Strait relations has reached a historical height that other factors fail to play an intervening role of neutralizing the effectiveness of these two powerful independent variables. Indeed, if the bipartisan consensus in the United States is to rebalance a rising China with more regional partners and to redefine cross-Strait status quo beyond the constraint of one-China policy, less leeway will be left for the interplay of executive and legislative branches within federal government of the United States. And if the bipartisan consensus between the ruling Democratic Progressive Party and the opposition Kuomintang in Taiwan is to rely on America to void off pressure from the mainland rather than seeking political conciliation with the latter, the ‘cold confrontation’ across the Strait can only add new nutrition to more intimate connection between Washington and Taipei. The gradual ‘normalization’ of U.S.-Taiwan ties may even ironically reduce the relevance of the Taiwan lobby, since the bilateral ties have been restored to a plateau with more institutionalized communication and exchange channels. A content analysis of the pro-Taiwan acts approved by the Trump administration suggests the danger of normalization of U.S-Taiwan relations with Congress and the White House as the co-engines, which was rarely seen since Washington switched its diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing in 1979. Will congressional activism in Taiwan-related legislation in the Trump administration vanish under the Joe Biden administration when the Democrats barely maintain a unified government? In view of the trauma of American domestic politics and economic recession, a reserved foreign policy is in order, which requires more bipartisanship and institutional checks and balances. Normatively, unconstrained congressional activism or Presidential dominance in foreign affairs encourages interventionist policy.44 Empirically, whether the White House can free itself from congressional heavy hands in foreign affairs is contingent upon whether the President enjoys leadership authority and personal charisma. President Carter’s decision to declare the establishment of U.S.-China relations during the congressional recess had provoked those pro-Taiwan members of Congress who were under the influence of the Taiwan lobby and led to the legislation of the Taiwan Relations Act. Likewise, President Clinton’s shaky moral position in his second term (partly because of his sex scandal) made Congress more reactive against his policy of engagement with the PRC at the cost of Taiwan, contributing to the booming of Taiwan-related legislation, and President Trump’s unpopularity triggered a strong reaction from Congress and resulted in more Taiwan-related legislation. By contrast, President Reagan’s pro-Taiwan image during the presidential campaign and the Six Assurances he made to Congress as well as Taiwan might have preempted an otherwise stronger reaction from Congress against the ‘August 17 Communiqué.’ It is worthy to note that the booming of Taiwan-related legislation in the late years of Carter and the early years of Clinton and Trump accompanies with a unified government. A unified government, nevertheless, does not necessarily lead to congressional activism, as the first two years of the Obama administration (with a low degree of Taiwan-related legislation) suggest, thanks to the simultaneous improvement of U.S.-China and cross-Strait relations then. In the post-Trump era, Washington is poised to ‘take on directly the challenges’ posed by its ‘most serious competitor,’ i.e. China. According to President Biden, Washington will ‘confront China’s economic abuses; counter its aggressive, coercive action; to push back on China’s attack 44As Wallner observes earlier, “If the various constraints on Congress’s foreign policy activism lead to a more reserved foreign policy stance, presidential dominance encourages interventionist policy. See Wallner, ‘A Dynamic Relationship’, p. 34. 624 G. LIN ET AL. on human rights, intellectual property, and global governance.’ However, it is ‘ready to work with Beijing when it’s in America’s interests to do so.’45 It is likely that the Biden administration will handle the Taiwan issue within the traditional one-China policy, rather than delinking the two policy issues and playing the Taiwan card as wildly as former President Trump did amid the atmosphere of anti-globalism, anti-establishment, and anti-elitism. This does not suggest that the sentiment of ‘China basing’ is likely to recede, particularly in Congress. Rather, Congress will continue to involve itself in Taiwan-related legislative activities, the degree of which, however, is greatly contingent upon the dynamic state of U.S.-China relations as well as cross-Strait ties.",

    "abstract": "The suspension of Ant Group’s IPO in November 2020 shocked investors and marked a turning point in China’s regulatory landscape. This article examines the legal and political reasons behind the suspension, focusing on how China’s regulatory authorities shifted from a growth-first approach to one that emphasizes financial stability and risk prevention. The Ant case demonstrates the challenges of regulating large fintech companies whose business models straddle traditional banking and innovative digital platforms. By analyzing Ant Group’s structure, regulatory responses, and the broader political economy, this article shows that the suspension was not just about Ant itself, but also about reasserting Party-state control over the financial sector in the digital era.",
    "conclusion": "In conclusion, the case of Ant’s IPO suspension is a good starting point to understand the underlying rationale for China’s financial regulation. The halting had its legal basis, economic reasons, and political motivation. The public’s emphasis on the story’s political aspects highlights the difficulties regulators face in a fast-growing market as they shift from a traditional entitybased regulatory framework to a more activity-oriented approach. While China’s financial regulatory landscape remains in flux, the case of Ant has provided valuable lessons for regulators and other FinTech companies and proclaimed an era of more stringent oversight after 2020.",

    "abstract": "The recent popularization of generative artificial intelligence (GAI) applications, such as ChatGPT and other large language model (LLM)-powered chatbots, has led many to expect transformative changes in legal practice. However, the actual use of LLM chatbots in the legal field has been limited. This Essay identifies China's public legal services (PLS) sector as a potential use case where AI chatbots may become widely and quickly adopted. China's political economy is generally conducive to such adoption, as the government must rely on technological solutions to fulfill its commitment to universal access to PLS. The Legal Tech industry is keen to find a practical use case for its LLM chatbots, which with proper development and fine-tuning could function adequately in meeting a significant popular demand for basic legal information. The use of AI chatbots in China's PLS sector could contribute not only to narrowing the gap in access to justice but also to strengthening the degree of legality in governance that the country has achieved through years of deliberate efforts. But such use could also raise a range of concerns, including loss of confidentiality, errors and inaccuracies, fraud and manipulation, and unequal service quality. On balance, however, AI chatbots *528 offer benefits in the PLS sector as a positive innovation, and the risks associated with their adoption appear manageable through pragmatic approaches.",
    "conclusion": "Using an emerging use case from China, this Essay argues that near-term adoption of “robo-lawyers,” especially in their early form of AI chatbots, makes better sense in the public legal services context than in private practice. The chatbots will help close a part of the access-to-justice gap that is often overlooked. And the risks associated with their adoption appear manageable through pragmatic approaches. The favorable prospect for PLS chatbots surely has much to do with China’s state-dominated approach to constructing legality and the delivery of legal services. However, it is not unique to China that the adoption of novel technologies tends to advance along a path of least resistance. If AI chatbots may eventually proliferate in the law, there is also reason for us to prefer that they first be led into the public services scenario where, at least in the critical formative stage, there is less pressure on AI product developers to pursue quick profits at the expense of societal interests.",

    "abstract": "This research offers a first-of-its-kind examination of the impact of judicial overload on administrative litigation. We examined how the Chinese courts, faced with an explosive increase in workload caused by a legal reform in 2015, adjudicated expropriation disputes between the government and property rights holders. We used the variation of changes in the administrative case workload brought about by the 2015 reform across the courts to identify the causal effect of workload on the adjudication of expropriation cases. Employing a difference-in-differences method, we found an increased judicial workload to improve property rights holders’ chances of winning their case against the government. We explored the mechanism of judicial decision-making to understand this counterintuitive result and discovered that judges’ use of hard-edged legal doctrine-administrative procedures, in particular-to save time constrained judicial discretion, which is prone to arbitrary political influence in authoritarian regimes. We also examined the limits of the constraining power of legal doctrine.",
    "conclusion": "The workload crisis is a major problem for courts around the world, with existing research documenting the effects of judicial overload on the delivery of justice, particularly in the domains of criminal justice and the resolution of civil and commercial disputes. This paper is the first of its kind to broaden the inquiry into a consideration of the impact of judicial workload on the delivery of justice within the realm of administrative litigation, which concerns judicial checks on the abuse of administrative power and the protection of individual rights against such abuse. Using hand-coded data from China, where the power of the courts to check authoritarian power is presumptively weak, we found that an increased judicial workload both increases property rights holders’ chances of winning their case again the government and prompts judges to support claims based on hard-edged rules, specifically administrative procedures, in deciding expropriation litigation. Judges’ incentives to use time-saving rules to adjudicate cases constrains judicial discretion, which is prone to arbitrary political influence (particularly from the local level) in authoritarian regimes. Our study also provides evidence on and refined analysis of the role of the courts in authoritarian regimes. This study demonstrates that legal doctrines matter (Lax 2011), even in an authoritarian context. Joining Epstein, Landes and Posner (2013: 38-9), we call for 47 further investigation of the judicial choice of legal doctrines in the face of an increased workload, particularly in the comparative and authoritarian contexts.",
